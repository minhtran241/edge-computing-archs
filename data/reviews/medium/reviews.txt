Perhaps good product, but really poor service. My wife and I stopped here to purchase a bike rack for our Rav4. We noticed a Rav4 in the parking lot with a bike rack and asked the salesperson (Jim) if he could help us determine if it met some of our criteria (does not cause bike damage to mounted back tire; allows back door to swing open for rear access). Jim was telling us some things that contradicted information I had found online; so we asked if he could help us track down the owner. This was over the top for Jim and he made derogatory comments as he strutted away to hide in the back of the store.  My wife and I tracked down the Rav4 owner on our own and he was more than happy to share his experience and contradict Jim's "guesses" that were portrayed as fact.I had never been in a situation where a sales person abandoned me in a store before; so I contacted the owner (Darren). He apologized and indicated that we would receive a 20% discount on another bike rack that he had in stock and that I believed would meet our needs. I indicated I would think about the purchase offer, but really wanted an apology from the sales person. I was told the offer stood for as long as they had my desired bike rack in stock and that I would receive an apology from Jim. I decided to purchase a rack and followed up twice to make arrangements. Once I was ignored; the other time I was told they'd have to check inventory. I was never able to make arrangements to conclude the sale and never received an apology from the sales person. If you place importance on follow-through and commitment to customer satisfaction, I would suggest you consider other stores in the Madison area. I frequent several other stores that have excellent follow-through and place greater emphasis on customer satisfaction.
Been going here for specialty boat items for 10 years spanning ownership of 4 boats. Ordered something from a VERY helpful gentlemen last Saturday. I got a message the part had arrrived in precisely the time I was told... I show up to an empty store with 2 employees attending to a pallet of product. One asks me if I need help and I explain I'm there to pick up a special order part... He says "OK." and proceeds to put his hands in his pockets and talk to the girl attending to the pallet. 2 min later the girl begins walking towards us and asks my last name... She doesn't here me apparently and borderline yells "WHAT" at me. After repeating, she gets the part, tosses it on the counter, charges me and says, "Thanks" in a smart tone while walking away. Marine Max 1 mile away just got all of my business. You're welcome for a decade worth of business. Too bad you tossed it on a $3.16 part.
This place was a joke we rented 1 jet ski and brought it back with one scratch. I have been waiting over two weeks for him to tell us how much he's going to charge us why they have held our deposit. Hardly picks up Phone never calls back rarely is there.... Looked at all the good reviews thought it was a good place but I've had the worst experience ever.. By far the worst company I've ever dealt with.. Be careful!
We were out at the lake this weekend boating and towed a jet ski rented from Jet Action back to the dock.  Things happen, but when I called the office to help make arrangements for the couple "stuck" in the middle of the lake, I was treated rudely and told that "these things don't break down so I don't know what to tell you."  No suggestions or assistance was offered. I would NOT rent here.  Unhelpful and very rude.
I saw a cockroach here once.  Their ciabatta bread and crepes are almost delicious enough for me to look the other way, but I'm a little too grossed out to ever frequent this place again.
Worst Crepe !!!!!!! Being an European cafe if they don't know how to make a extremely simple Crepe, don't know what to write. We ordered 4 crepes, and they all were bad, uncooked crepe, very little filling. We are having stomach aches as well. Tried calling them and they kept us on hold for over 15 minutes..Weird!!!!  Don't know about other stuff but crepes are HORRIBLE..stay away if you are going there in the hope of a good Crepe as we did....
stop selling  day-old items as fresh and lying about it! c'mon!
I was dismayed by the poor service at the VetMed location.  After purchasing a pricey Roasted Red Pepper w smoked gouda soup, I was handed a cold soup and told to heat it up in the microwave.  Unsanitary and unprofessional.
Me giving one star is gracious. My roommate and I went here tonight. I have been to this restaurant when it was just the sushi room and loved it! However tonight was different. I made a reservation for 630, the hostess asked us to sit at the bar while they prepared the table,and then sat 12 other people at the table before she remembered the two of us. When we sat down we ordered, the waitress took forever to bring the soup which was Luke warm at best and tasted like soapy dish water. The salad didn't come until the chef started making our food. This was good. But as everyone was receiving their fried rice and steamed rice,my roommate and I noticed we had not gotten our steamed rice. We had to ask another waiter for rice.I had new York steak and shrimp. My roomie had chicken and filet mignon. My steak was over cooked I asked for medium rare. Her chicken as well was over cooked. Neither were seasoned barely at all. The shrimp was good tho. Unfortunately after I saw the owner ask a table full of people who were done eating and chatting if they could please move because while they appreciate their business there were people waiting. I knew my complaints would be irrelevant.Needless to say I'm disappointed in the food, the service, all of it. And will never go back for tempanyaki. They have alot of kinks to work out.
Yuck! Specialty rolls were definitely nothing special. Tasted like a packaged California roll you buy in a grocery store. The $9 short ribs were cold and super salty. When I told the waiter all he said was "sorry" and walked off. Maybe the Teppanyaki is better but if you want sushi or hand rolls drive east 10 minutes to Otaku!
Very bad customer service! Look out for the lady ismara behind the counter. She is the wetzel pretzel devil!
I walked up while the manager was cashiering. He was talking.inappropriately about a girl who.asked for an application and made it very awkward when ordering. I dont appreciate sexist people so I'll order from Auntie Anns now.
I was very upset, not with the quality of food but with the quality of management. I witnessed a manager say inappropriate things about a young girl and spoke about Wetzels and how they determine who works there. I'm sorry - but if she bought a pretzel and asked for an app, there's no excuse for rude behavior. Also, before you make snide remarks about customers, you should realize that customers pay your measly salary. Auntie Anns from now on.
Walking through the mall, sometimes you want one of those soft pretzels with dipping sauces they are serving up.On this particular occasion, we ordered the sour cream and onion pretzel with the nacho cheese and salsa dipping sauce, a garlic pretzel with nacho cheese and salsa dipping sauce, and a pretzel dog.I can't remember much else because within 15 minutes of finishing, I was in search of the ladies' room.  Stomach cramps, chills, and the sweats...ran to the toilet and out it went.  Bad cheese, perhaps(I do still visit other pretzel locations when I'm at the mall, this so happens to be the only time I visited this Auntie Anne's location.)
The pretzels didn't look so fresh, and the shift leader has an attitude.
Worst service ever. Buy 2 pretzel and large drink and get free pretzel, and display pretzel cups and don't honor that such false advertisement. Not a happy customer. Then they start arguing and getting defensive. If I could not give a star I would. They need to fix this. Use a pretzel picture instead of the pretzel cup
Just like earlier reviews , I received an attitude and bad service. Don't want to honor my card and after I downloaded my apps, don't want to do it.  If there is a lower star than 1, I'd happily give it to them.
Got this as a gift from Groupon....it was actually alot of fun...we knew we would get our butt kicked by a bunch of 12 year olds....but with that being said....they give you a 10 minute orentation about the rules which all make sense. the people managing the field do nto pay attention and inforce these safety rules. teams are not matched fairly....a bunch of 12 year olds agains a pro team....a guy on the other team stuck the barrell of his fully auto paitball gun under my face mask after he was shot out and shot me in the face. after i was out i proceeded to leave the field with my hands in the air ( as instructed) and the same guy unloaded about 15-20 rounds on me within 5 feet which again is against the rules. i questioned the guy on why he did it and he grabbed me by the shirt and proceeded to instigate a fight.  ALL OF THIS HAPPENED IN FRONT OF A YOUNG BLONDE FEMALE STAFF MEMBER WHO DID NOTHING! the staff didnt do much about this other than appologize and offer me a free visit. they contunued to let the violent gentelman stay and play when he should of been kicked out. there was also a dad and his 3 kids that  questioned the staff about the rules not being followed and they ended up leaving due to carelessness from the staff. needless to say....it would of been a ton of fun if the rules given were monotored. WILL GO TO ANOTHER PAINTBALL FACILITY NEXT TIME.
Absolutely horrible experience. I would give half a star if possible. It is overpriced for the size and style of arena. It is understaffed and unprofessional. I dropped my gun off to get work done and before I left to go to Tempe paintball to pick it up I notified the one employee on staff that I would be coming. When I got there I arrived to a locked door and after calling 17 times, knocking on the door for nearly 15 minutes and standing outside for nearly 20 minutes and leaving 2 voicemails I finally got my gun back. I will never return to Tempe Paintball nor will I ever refer a friend or enemy there... That would just be cruel. If your looking for a good place to go go to Westworld Indoor Paintball. It's a little bit of a drive but WAY more worth your money.
everything is a cluster.  the store.  the parking lot.  the people -- customers included.  full-on cluster. barely any parking for a massive, heavily polluting pick up truck.inside: avocados are the price of gold, and there are no goddamn vegan taco spices at a place that's supposed to be so fancy.  meh.  go to market district where they keep it real.  real classy!!!
the parking lot  this wholefoods is an ABOMINATION!  to compound the issue, whole foods allows their purveyors to park on centre ave (a road that is already miserable enough to drive on) and block traffic. this past monday, a shearer potato chip truck was blocking the right lane. doesn't whole foods have a loading dock i wrote an email to the district president and he had one of his store minions respond: "you can park  walgreens". sorry, i am shopping  wholefoods NOT walgreens. translation: whole foods developers were TOO CHEAP to buy the proper amount of real estate. dont even bother coming here fri-sun unless you like a clusterF*** lot full of zombies. this is the 5th WF i have shopped  (4 in florida) wholefoods should have opened in the south hills. the demographics out there would support it. this wholefoods is BUSH LEAGUE!
I have tried Whole Foods recently even after hearing about the attitude of the butthole, hipster employees and presumptuous, anti-bourgeois customers that will literally push you aside a turn their noses up at you a million times. The rumors were true!!! Even though I was only there one time, first impressions are a bitch! The selection is great! I can't afford any of it, but it's great! I have never seen such expensive rice! Here is the bro-down...The food: Plentiful and too expensive to even think of buying. The freshest fish that isn't in the Strip...but you need to take a second mortgage to buy fish for a family. I bought sushi rice, a piece of fish and a salad, my bill: $25! The salad with lettuce, carrots, chick peas, onions and about 5 pieces of chicken was $11+The employees: Hipsters with thick-rimmed glasses, tattoos and facial piercings that slack like I have never seen "workers" slack before. In fact there was a sign above some fresh fish stating "We will prepare you fish any way you want, just ask" HA...HA! When I asked to have a tiny fish to be filleted (something that would take me about 10 seconds at home) I was scoffed at by the so called fish monger who was obviously not a trained fish monger, but got his job because of his Progressive music of the soviet era bachelors degree . It took him the better part of 20 minutes to fillet a f-ing fish! All I got was a chopped up piece of crap that was useless. And scoffing is what these people are good at. Pushing your cart down the aisles is like running a scoffing gauntlet. Staff huff and puff when you get in their way! The cashiers just stand and talk to each other or run to get organic iced tea to drink WHILE they ring you up...they don't even do that at Giant Eagle!The other customers: This one is a peach! If you're not pulling in a good $60K a year you are dirt to these people. I was at the salad bar (it is a good salad bar, but expensive) an older woman in a mink coat bumped, no, pushed into me then stared at me and turned her nose up at me, can you believe it She actually turned her nose up at me! Others in the aisles will grunt like cantankerous old people if they can't get through. They push ahead in line, give you dirty looks, and act like it's a class struggle...it kind of is!So unless you have a lot (i mean A LOT) of disposable income, have never needed to use coupons, drive a $50K car (parking is terrible there), are the president of the United States, CEO of Microsoft, a widow whose wardrobe is more extensive than the explanation of the formula explaining an event horizon or a hipster who looks poor, but lives off daddy and mommy (though they'll never admit it) you shouldn't and really won't be able to afford this place...but why would you want toI'll stick with Trader Joe's for my alternative market, thank you! I prefer employees with edges that are a little rough to ones with pants so tight, I can see their junk.
I always thought 1-star reviews on Yelp were written by bitter, resentful people who had nothing better to do than just complain. But now I feel their pain. It really doesn't hit you, until it... hits you.You pay a premium at WF, you expect a premium, right Well parking is part of the shopping experience. It's why they have parking lots in the first place. But never mind the atrocious parking lot and not being able to easily maneuver in it.I'm talking about being TOWED. Towed, not for leaving the parking lot, but for legitimately shopping at WF. Yes, this could happen to you too.Upon contacting the towing company, they demanded $135 (cash only) to return my vehicle. Upon contacting WF (since I was a legitimate shopper there and didn't leave the lot) they just shrugged their shoulders and just told me the name of the company that managed the lot.And that's it! $135 is no chump change, but it seems like WF wants me to carry an extra $135 every time I frequent them (thankfully, never, since I don't live in Pittsburgh). This whole parkingtowing situation is extremely shady, but the only company I'm going to point my finger at is Whole Foods for doing business with such a shady complex and passing the burden on to its customers.Tip: Bring an extra $135 to pay for parking, or just go to Trader Joe'sGiant Eagle for a better parkingshopping experience.
The store has a weird rotting meat smell sometimes. The selection isn't amazing but there are a few interesting items here. As other people commented there are always people hanging around outside.... But they are friendly at least to me! One thing I like about the store is the proximity to my house. The biggest let down is the sky high prices that I think GE is notorious for... I miss Kroger
Smelly, moldy and just plain gross! It is difficult to say you're doing something healthy when you're staring at the ceiling and all the mold is staring right back at you... The yoga itself is great however it is hard to get over the unbearable smell of sweat that slaps you in the face the moment you walk in.. I'm sure there are better places to try in town!
Wetzels's Pretzels is definitely amazing and very crave-able. I am pretty boring when it comes to pretzels... I like them plain with salt. No dipping sauce or weird pizza flavors for me. Wetzel's offers delicious plain pretzels and bite size wetzel bits as well which are perfect for sharing! Also if all that salt leaves you feeling thirsty try their frozen lemonades. They have regular and cherry, but usually ask them to mix them for me. Snaking perfection!
I LOVE WETZEL'S PRETZELS.  My husband and I will come to the mall specifically for Wetzel's and nothing else. We'll make up an excuse to go to the mall and then be all like, oh yeah, and let's get a pretzel while we are there. We always get the bitz and they are so soft and fluffy. Lately the ones on the bottom don't seem to get as much butter love as the ones on top, but that's what I save the pizza sauce for.
Sooooo good!!!! Way better than Auntie Anns although Auntie Anns is not bad. I love the plain pretzel (butter but no salt) with cheese. Sooo much butter and cooked to perfection at Wetzels. I watched the girl making them too and she was a pro! The hubby and I can't help but to get one of these when we are wandering around the Chandler Mall which is usually after having dinner at a place in or around the mall and going to see the puppies at puppies of love. That tells you how much we love these pretzels. We are usually already full but we have to get one anyways!!! My new motto: "There is always room for a pretzel!"The only thing I have noticed is that these are a bit slow. Not sure why when they have everything already made and all they have to do is grab it and give it to you.... hmmm
Best mall pretzels. Better than Auntie Anns! They are very doughy and buttery (which I like). My friend got the pizza pretzel and said the dough was not like the pretzel dough, so I would not recommend that one. My kids always ask for them at the mall, it's hard to say no because I want some too.
I love love love their huge unsalted (and cinnamon sugar) pillowy soft delicious pretzels. I am a big fan of soft (and hard, for that matter) pretzels- great snacks unless they have too much butter. I just don't like salt too much. Pretzels can be a healthy alternative to other mall choices provided it's not soaked in salt and butter. The other pretzel companies try to outdo Auntie Anne's but I really don't think that they can. Jeez, craving one as I am typing up my review.

This is THE BEST place to eat in Pittsburgh.  I wish I could give this place 10 stars.  I love pretzels!  I love this place.  I love that they won't wait on you if you are talking on your cell phone.  I love that lunch is less than $3.My second favorite food to pretzles is probably rice krispie treats - and they sell those too.  LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!! I am adding some pictures of fresh pretzels!
After having had a terrible pretzel from the Reading Terminal in Philadelphia, we happened to park right in front of this shop when we were going to explore Carson Street. You walk in and there are just pretzels behind the counter, kind of like what we're used to seeing with bagel shops here on the West Coast. Each one was $.50. You can't beat it. We shared one since we were on an eating mission and it was a darn good pretzel. Lots of locals inside just grabbing pretzels here and there to go.TY wanted to take some back to LA, so we asked how well they kept. We were told that you could take them back and throw them in the freezer, but since we were homeless, having checked out of the hotel already, we had to forgo any extras.
This is one of my most favorite places in Pittsburgh.   I love pretzels and these are way better than the ones from the mall that are dripping in butter.  The pretzel sandwiches are less than $3 and a great lunch - not too much food.  I also like this place because it is one of the few place you can buy rice krispie treats.  This is just a great little neighborhood shop, that makes a great pretzel for an amazing price.  When they had to raise the price to $.50 they even posted a sign apologizing and explaining the price of the ingredients had gone up.  I definitely would put this on my list of places to eat in Pittsburgh.
If I had a weakness, it would be the Pretzel Shop.  I'm there all the time!  Even though the shop is tiny and you can't eat inside, there is always a line to get food.  Sandwiches are no more than $3.00 and they have great cookies, muffins and desserts.  Seriously, a couple of slices of meat and cheese between a sliced pretzel NEVER tasted so good.
Ok. So you're in the mall (I'm sorry for you, really I am.) you smell that salty baked pretzel smell and suddenly you think going to Auntie Anne's is a good idea. You're wrong. Dead wrong.Hold out for some Pretzel Shop love. The place is not only easy to find being right on East Carson Street in the Southside of Pittsburgh, but it has the absolute cheapest and FRESHEST pretzels ever. The downside, you can't sit down to eat inside and there is always a line. Honestly neither of these deter me as I am perfectly happy being a stoop-dweller and taking up someone else's front steps to eat one of these salty snacks. The line just tells me that it's worth it. The prices literally are rock bottom. Don't miss a chance to get something, even just to take home, from here. Delish.
As Pittsburgh as Pittsburgh gets.Not as cheap as it once was but I love these pretzel sandwiches.Everyone should stop by and get at least a pretzel. You will love it.Line can be a little long around lunch time but it moves fast.I like the chicken salad pretzel the best.Also get a cinnamon and sugar pretzel.
The Pretzel Shop is a Pittsburgh classic.  I would give the quality of the pretzels 4 stars, but when you factor in the low cost, and quaint set-up- this place gets bumped up to 5 stars.  It's a great place to stop by for a pretzel sandwich on a Saturday, for a breakfast sandwich (any day but Sunday), or to get a ton of soft pretzels on the cheap if you have people coming over.  All in all, the Pretzel Shop is a must-go if you are in the South Side.
Cheap, great food, family owned, wonderful employees.  The service is always with a smile.  The daily specials are great and they are conveniently located with extended business hours!
Amazing! Don't waste your time with the sandwiches or pizza--all that stuff just gets in the way of the main event: the pretzel! Best pretzel in the city.  Best anything in the anywhere. Cheap, too. Only complaint: not open late enough.
The Pretzel Shop is one of those unique places that every city has. A wonderfully extra thick pretzel cut in half, slathered with sauce, and topped with your favorite pizza toppings, a pretzel pizza, screw the low carb diet!  Or, take the same pretzel, cut it in half and pile on turkey and cheddar, or ham and swiss, and you have a great sandwich with the extra crunch of salt from the pretzel top. What else do you need Grab a sack full or a dozen or so pizza pretzels take them home, pop them in the oven and you have a great meal for the big game. I love this place!
This place should have a lot more reviews - but I'm glad it doesn't, they don't need to get any busier.Its been there ages, and looks it. If you're all about ambiance, don't bother. If you pretend you're in a movie set in Pittsburgh 30 years ago it works pretty well. The service is sometimes hit or miss. Most of girls are good, one is very slow, one is amazing. They are all friendly and usually a few different people will check in to make sure that you're happy. Everything is made fresh so be prepared that nothing comes flying out of that kitchen - busy times it can take a good while to get food. The food is AWESOME! Worth any little complaints I might think up before it gets there. Once its on the table, I forget them all.-Fish Sandwiich-Salmon (huge and delicious)-Flounder-Shrimp a few ways ("Norfolk" style is oily for my taste, and I never had it growing up in Norfolk.)-Hawkins St Special-Prime Rib (sized for two, watch it)The prices are low, the portions are large, and just about everything on the menu  is delicious. I'm not one to pick a place because they give you a lot of food, but if you like a good value and don't want to compromise on taste, this place is a gem.
Old school.....traditional "mom 'n pop" quality and perfection. The best fish and chips you'll ever enjoy and equally superb fried shrimp. A great out of the way, non-corporate, vestige of Americana. You will love it.
Seen this restaurant on 25 best places in Pittsburgh with Rick Sebackack. Went there with my girlfriend she grew up with the owner. She's very nice all employees are super nice service was excellent i had the fish sandwich my girlfriend had the Ruben more than you could possibly eat very reasonable prices. Going back to try the burgers  i heard there enormous and very tasty.
Had a great experience with Frank and his team.  It was our daughter's Sweet 16, and it was perfect.  They walked us through all the things we needed to know, and helped us from the first phone call to the last song.  It really helped to have them reassure us that they would entertain 60 kids, and we didn't have to worry!  The light show is a must.  It took the music to a different level.  I recommend Windy City DJ's for your needs.  Don't be afraid to ask questions, because they've done it all and can help you with a lot of details!
We hired Ray the DJ after extensive dj research for our wedding. There are so many bad djs out there that we wanted to be sure. Ray the DJ has very competitive prices and Brenda who is in the main office is terrific. She answered all of our e-mails quickly and was always very professional. We hired Marcus from Ray and he was awesome!! He meet with us before we even hired him so we could find out about his background and experience. We loved Marcus right away. However, at Ray they give you the chance to choose a different DJ in case you don't "click" with your first DJ. Marcus was very professional and played all the songs we requested and provided us with great suggestions. After the wedding we got so many compliments about our DJ. For any brides out there looking for a great DJ I would highly recommend Ray the DJ and Marcus.
Ray made our wedding reception absolutely phenomenal! He timed all of the little special requests perfectly (like me surprising my husband with a groom's cake). He read the group on the dance floor perfectly and because of that, we didn't stop dancing until our time ran out. He even went along with a surprise our friends had for us that called for a certain song. Could not have imagined that night as perfectly as it turned out. Thank you Ray!
Jeremy at Ray the DJ was simply fantastic. I met with at least 6 other DJs before finding Jeremy. Not only were his prices $250 below all the others, he was friendly, professional, knowledgeable, and went above and beyond to ensure I got what I wanted. He offered several add-ons to my package, but never pushed. He communicated with me regularly and gave suggestions, but never tried to steer me away from the music and vision I had for my reception. I loathe the cheesy DJ thing, and he was the epitome of class and professionalism. My guests danced the entire time, and that is the true mark of a great DJ. You will NOT be disappointed with Jeremy at Ray the DJ!
The decision on the DJ for our wedding was made the moment we met with Jeff from Ray the DJ.  He is older for a man of his profession (not a kid in his 20's that you'd expect to be working as a partyevent DJ) but it didn't take long for him to win us over.  The man is all charm and character.  We could tell that he really loved music and what he does.  I almost wanted to pull him out from behind the turntables, sit down, and have a few drinks with him. He couldn't have been any better at the reception.  He played everything we asked for, flowed perfectly with our timeline (including working with us to finish some schmoozing before moving on to the next part), He could get our guest's attention but never tried to make himself the star of the show, and he knew how to keep the party going.  The only negative thing I can say about Jeff was that he took an awful request from my new sister in law (but in all fairness to him, she wanted to dance with her husband to their wedding song, so I can't blame him), but he quickly recovered as soon as the track ended.  Probably with the exception of that song, people were on the dance floor until the final song.
For our wedding, we were very wary about DJ's because we had been to many wedding where the DJ absolutely sucked.....well not this company!Our DJ was Mike, and he was awesome! We met two or three times prior to the wedding just to go over everything, and Mike made sure that he had all the correct info. My dad STILL says how great he was, and our wedding was over 2 months ago! We constantly heard how great he was from many ages of our guests. I would recommend this company to anyone looking for a good time.Mike also was the MC for the wedding, and he did a great job! No complaints in any way at all! Their website is also very very helpful when it comes to picking songs. We weren't picky about songs, and chose to trust him when it came to the music, and boy are we happy we did that! Like i said before, everyone loved him!!! Great job Ray the DJ!
Chad is amazing! Working with him was more enjoyable than I thought working with a DJ could be! He made the entire process a breeze from initial consultation to our Last Dance. Chad has a unique and amazing ability to read a crowd and energize a group in just the right way to ensure each guest feels included in each moment of your event. Chad embraced our non-traditional song choices and offered valuable suggestions during our planning to make our event extra special. With Chad, you're not just getting a DJ - you're gaining a fun, fresh, funky friend who will masterfully guide each moment of your special day to make sure that it reflects you're vision and personality - as well as that of your guests, and infuses both into the greatest party you'll ever experience! Chad lays out the planning process in easy to follow worksheets and provides a wealth of suggestions, both on paper and in person, to make sure you are able to craft an event that reflects energy, enjoyment, and personality from beginning to end. I would recommend working with Chad on any event where you're looking for an experienced and talented master to be your Director of Fun!
I can go on and on about Chad!  I can guarantee that he'll be the best DJ you'll ever work with!  We hired him for our st. pattys day wedding this past year and our guests are still talking about how much fun they had on our day.  If you want a creative, fun, not typical wedding entertainment,  Chad will be your guy!  He has many ideas to make your day fun and stress free.  When we first met him, right off the bat you could tell he is a very professional, organized, yet a kind hearted guy.  So easy to work with that you'll want to plan another event so you could hire him again.  We miss our day and the entertainment made our wedding day so memorable!
My husband and I used SKM for our wedding DJ, MC, and videography.  We were thoroughly impressed with their professionalism, timeliness, and organization during the planning.  They were always one step ahead of us and made everything so easy for us.  We loved our MC, Chris.  He was very friendly and attentive to what we wanted at our reception.  He really took control, and we were worry free all night.  He kept checking in to see if I needed anything, which was very nice.  All the guests had a wonderful time at the wedding.  He had everyone on the dance floor and no one wanted to stop dancing.  The DJ, Gavin, did a great job with the music! I highly recommend both of them for your event.  We also booked our videography, David, for a great price.  We are waiting to get the video, but know it will come out great.  He stayed the whole time and even interviewed my grandparents.  I can't wait to see it.  Thank you SKM for making our night go so smoothly.  You took great care of us, and we got to just enjoy the night, our family, and friends.  Thank you!!
These wonderful people did our wedding this past March and I just have to say it was an absolute joy and pleasure to work with them! Miles and his group were very accommodating and the flow of the wedding was fantastic. We had people come from all over and my cousins in Florida commented how great of a time it truly was! I couldn't be more happy. And to see my wife's face throughout it all...that was my joy. Thank you so much to these great people! I like how they were always consulting with us and kept it stress free. Pricing was perfect and spot on. We were able to pick and choose a custom package and the sound was awesome. It was the best I've ever seen and I would have no problem referring these good people to anyone!
SKM was one of the best choices we made for our wedding.  I was worried when first selecting them because they are a bit pricey, but after meeting Nathan at a bridal show, I was intrigued enough to set up a consultation.  My husband and I were immediately impressed with how thorough they were in the planning process and booked them despite the cost.  It was totally worth it. Nathan (our MC) was super helpful with all of my planning questions throughout the process, even answering annoying texts from me the week of the wedding with last minute questions.  He offered great suggestions for timelines and songs for events.  The event itself was spectacularly run. The two-person team was flawless.  All of the transitions from tradition to tradition were well handled.  They coordinated with all of the other vendors well and with the guests.  Nathan consistently checked in with us to make sure we were having a good time.  He was involved with our guests, asking them what they wanted to hear and actually playing those songs (My uncle leapt out of his seat when Brick House, his choice, came on).   Nathan learned important people's names and used them at the wedding.  He involved guests at all stages so there was never a dull moment.  He even got out on the dance floor and taught guests the wobble.  Our guests raved about SKM and their experience.  SKM definitely made our wedding unforgettable for us and all of our guests.
Skm rocks! Very organized and professional. Nathan was amazing as our MC! I would recommend this company to anyone for any event! We'll done.
Jimmy D with Starz Entertainment did a fantastic job providing us DJ services for our wedding and reception. Jimmy D has a great and well-deserved reputation in the DJ community. We are lucky we were able to hire him to DJ our wedding and reception. He has many years of experience and it shows. He was energetic and super professional in every aspect of the planning and execution of our wedding and reception. He answered our emails immediately and met with us several times before the wedding to make sure we had everything set up the way we wanted. He spent hours before and after, setting up to make sure the lighting and sound was the best it could be. He had great suggestions for songs and activities and helped make our wedding and reception absolutely perfect. It was seamless, and everyone had a great time! We highly, highly, recommend Jimmy D and Starz Entertainment for DJ services!
Jimmy D is the best DJ that you will find in Arizona! I attended a wedding that he DJed and he did such a great job that I booked him when I got married 4 years later! He gets everyone up and dancing, there wasn't a single person in the room who wasn't dancing once Jimmy opened the dance floor! He is so fun, charismatic, and extremely professional. I highly recommend anyone who is looking for someone to entertain guests of all ages, who can control the energy of the room, and who is easy and delightful to work with!
Jimmy did an absolute amazing job as our wedding DJ. It's the only wedding I have ever seen where the dance floor was PACKED all night long. Not only was his playlist amazing, his ability to keep everything organized and on track was very key. We actually didn't have a wedding planner, and without Jimmy there to basically run the show, I'm not sure what we would've done. His assistant Carie was awesome as well. She played a really key role in keeping everything up to speed and organized. We would highly recommend Jimmy and Starz Entertainment!  SUPER IMPRESSED!!!!!
Homeless in the park! How unheard of! Not really, folks. It may be unappealing for you suburbanites who choose to live within the confines of a tiny box, but not for me, a born and raised city girl who has adapted to urban culture and diversity. I love this park, and have been going here for years. It's small, quiet (on most days), and green. I go there when I don't want to deal with crowded parks like Sunset. Actually, I have mostly given up on Sunset and replaced it with Paradise. :) The way these people make Paradise out to be is totally not what it really is. I say, check it out for yourself. If you prefer grass and matured trees over the dull gravely desert landscapes found in these newer 'homeless free' parks, or you just want to get away from crowded parks, but still want to enjoy the greenery, then Paradise is the place to go. I have had a lot of peaceful picnics here. Never had a problem with homeless people (who I've barely scene) or drug dealers (who I've NEVER seen, and I've hung out here late at night to have some wine with friends.). I mostly picnic on the Northeast side of the park. Lots of shade, grass, and beautiful big trees to be enjoyed. :)
Fun for Everyone! My daughter had a softball tournament here and the facilities are awsome! They have everything you could ask for out of a community park. For example, softballbaseball fields, batting cages, skate park, rec center gym, sand volleyball courts, splash pad, and they even have a few fishing ponds for those wanting to relax. I also saw that they had teen dodgeball tournament going on in their rec center. They probably have some more stuff to do there that I didnt get a chance to check out cause this place is huge! They have a baseball store and a Starbucks also! Very cool place.
I love Rio Vista. It is a huge park fully equipped with a recreation center, skate park, volleyball nets, baseball fields, etc. The scenery is absolutely gorgeous. Being a amateur photographer, I love to bring "models" here so that I can shoot them. The park is really nice and kept up.
Great park! Me and my boyfriend came here to have a picnic. Of course I referred to Yelp before making any decision on which park I should go to and this park popped up. At first I was hesitant because there weren't a lot of photos but the reviews were good. I was pleasantly surprised and happy that I did end up coming. The park is huge! They have a skate park, a volleyball area, and baseball areas. They also have a good trail to ride bikes or go walking. You can even go fishing! And the major plus is that this park is really clean!There are a lot of picnic areas and places to grill. So if you are looking for a family outing or just a relaxing day this is your place!
This is such a beautiful park! I won't reiterate the amenities most of the other reviews have pointed out, but the rec center is really clean and there's a lot of activities inside as well. I have yet to take advantage of their trails and picnic areas, though I will definitely make it a point to do so!
These are great baseballsoftball fields!I'm not a City of Peoria resident and I don't visit this park for anything other than my son playing youth baseball  - both in club baseball and district little league tournaments.The Rio Vista baseballsoftball fields are some of the nicest, best maintained fields in the valley.  It's obvious the city cares about this park and their sports programs.  The grass is always green, cut and simply wonderful.  The infields are well maintained, well striped and watered, with one exception - the pitching mound on Field 7 has deteriorated to the point of being a pitching bump.  As of June 2011 It's far from the 12" height required for Little League play.  That being said, it's still a nice grass infield to play on.I've had the opportunity to work with the staff at Rio Vista park too, just to communicate baseball scores during District 2 little league tournaments.  The staff is a joy to work with.Thanks for a wonderful place for the kids to play baseball!
Def a favorite park of mine here in Vegas. It's very calm, and out of the way. Very spacious. There is a diverse playground for kids, a number of athletic fields, bathrooms pavillions and barbeque grills. Really everything you could want from a park except maybe a fountain or something, but hey, it's the desert!
So, let me first say that yes, I was a bit tipsy when I agreed to go on a ghost hunt. But apparently I was not the only one. We arrived at the park to find other ghost hunters already waiting. We decided to join forces and wait it out together. The story goes that around three in the morning, one of the swings on the playground starts to move and you can hear a little kid singing. The haunting is documented on various places on the internet, and is considered one of the most haunted places in America. Huh. Didn't even know that until that night. I probably wouldn't have gone if I did.Anyway, so we waited a bit, and then maybe because we were tired and still pretty hammed up, or maybe because it was true, we saw the swing move!! Unbelievable!! Then it stopped. And I wish I could go on with the story, but that's the end.But if you are bored one night, I really recommend checking it out because if only for the heeby jeebies, it's worth it...
I wish NoVa had a place this size and this beautiful! We did four trails in about 2 hours and saw turtles, fish, birds of all kind! There were picnic areas with BBQ pits along the lake. I loved it!
Great Camping Amenities, Friendly Staff, and Waterfront Views. It is beautiful this time of year, and a chill way to spend a day. I especially love the trails, there are so many! It is the only campground in Mecklenburg County, and I just wish there were more like it!
Great place to go year round!I hike here all the time and love it. There are lots of short trails for quick hikes and you can loop a few together for a longer hike. Tons of picnic tables and lake scenery. Hiking and kayaking here is great. The nature center has some good displays as well. If you're lucky, you might catch a glimpse if some wildlife!
Short drive to a peaceful getaway. Pack a picnic, grab the pooch, and get ready for a great day.One of my latest Mecklenburg County discoveries is McDowell Nature Preserve. I love walking trails and getting absorbed in nature and this place fits the bill nicely. Beautiful, well-kept up place making you feel as though you are miles away from anything when in reality it is minutes from the city. There is a great campground to bring your tent and stay the night, a playground for the kiddos, many picnic tables, and plenty of trails to walk for miles. You can even fish, but there are signs posted that say caution because the fish may have a high dosage of mercury. If you are planning a reunion, this would probably be a great place to host it. Rent one of the areas, let people camp out, you are right next to the lake to rent kayaks in the spring and summer...you've got yourself one great family gathering spot!The Nature Center was closed when I was there, but I'm sure one of these days I'll stop in.
Great place right in the city, which will take you away from all the busy city life. The nature preserve has numerous hiking trails which are marked and some are good 2 to 3 mile loops. It has picnic tables and grills right besides the lake. Great place to take your dogs for a hike or running on the trails.
Love the nature trailsAnd the beautiful picnic areasA great place to take the family.
I drive by this place every single day going to work.  For the past 8 years I've always said, "I need to stop in here and check it out".  I did today.  I put my big boy pants on and decided to go for a walk  hike with my family and friends.I'm glad I did.  What a great spot....we entered at the trailhead at the parking lot, picked up a map and went exploring.  There are many different trails at the main location that you can choose some just hiking, some bikes and horses.  They give you the mileage and away we went.We walked for a few hours.....we encountered spiders, snakes and a lot of mountain bikers which was all great.  We had so much fun.  Funny, when you're walking you forget that this place is not far from a roadway since it is such a great spot of land.They ask for a donation to use the facilities but the box to put the $$ is wide open and not locked so I didn't feel comfortable leaving my $$ and info on an envelope, they should probably change that.  It was a gorgeous day, we got outside and had an absolute blast.
Aha, it's an ideal time to update my review from a year & a half ago for this place!  Norm R. & I got together tonight for the monthly "Birds & Beer" event here at the Audubon Center.  Like their FUN bird walks held every other Saturday morning at 8:30 most of the year (starting up again Sept. 10 I think), this event is excellent & FREE, including snack food & beer, courtesy of Tempe micro brewer Four Peaks!  Along with that, you get fellowship with a fun, eclectic crowd, & then a lecture with slides & short videos.  Tonight's topic was "Reptile Sex" & it was a hoot!Just like the bird walks (see my original review), "Birds & Beer is 5 STARS!  What a great place this is!     :-))
While at Birds n' Beer last Thursday, I learned what "riparian zone" means. It is the strip between land and stream or lake. (Cue the "The More  You Know" clip)The center itself is beautiful and great for a small - medium sized event. Lots of modern architecture and what looks like reclaimed materials. It's an eco-friendly building with great native landscaping.Now to the real part of the review: Bird and Beer is a great event, if you are free on a Thursday night between 5:30p and 7:30p. 5:30 to 6:30 is a chattingsnackingdrinking time with Four Peaks beer in a can. The lecture starts at 6:30 and is very informative. This month was reptile sex and last month was bird sex. The events are usually listed on the events section of Yelp, so check it out now.The Center is easy to find. It is just south of the river on Central, with a sign posted on the road pointing towards the building and the parking lot.
My trip should have been aptly called "Beards and Beer" instead of the "birds n beers."  Apparently I missed out on the typical "sex" themed talks, IE. frog sex, bird sex and flower sex.  Since this was the last event of the year, visitors got a stand up routine about beards from an official Beardo.  Wildly funny and entertaining stand up, the Four Peaks beer might have helped.  Four Peaks provided their main staple beers: Kilt lifter, Hop Knot and Kolsch.  3 styles to meet any palate.  Stop by and you'll meet their passionate staff and some friendly bird n beer enthusiasts.  There's no better way to to unwind after work, and learn a few things about that nature thing outside.
Phoenix is one of only 6 cities to get a center like this. They've taken a derelict parcel of ground and converted it into something beautiful and sustainable. Every time I go I see some special bird or bug that I haven't seen before. The River Pathways program is amazing and available to kids who might otherwise not get an experience like this.
It was such a treat to be out here after a couple of days of rain in AZ. The dessert was in bloom and there is absolutely nothing like running dessert trails in the beautiful state of Arizona. Because of time constraints, we opted to loop around Treasure trail for a short runhike. I was really sorry not to have brought a real camera. It was so beautiful out there. Like any other state farms, I would not go on a weekend to enjoy the park more.
What do you do when you need to get your cycling training but just do not have any desire to tote your road bike on vacation with you Rent a road bike right But, nobody rents road bikes. SO you thought. With an upcoming metric century and a desperate need for some training miles, I decided to do a google search with only little hope to find something. Thank goodness, AOA EXISTS!!!! This company offers tours, team building and bike rentals (including both mountain bikes and ROAD bikes.) And, don't think they just rent out 1970's 10 speeds either. They have Trek and Specialized road bikes in three classes. There is standard, performance, and high performance. I Each class is a different price. I opted for the middle of the road. I figured it would be much like my bike at home. I chose the Specialized over the Trek, since I ride a Specialized regularly. The components were mainly shimano, and the saddle Specialized. I made sure to bring my gel saddle, sure that my comfy girlie saddle from home would not come standard. A good bike overall, for mid range. The staff was very nice. They were able to take my reservation an hour before my ride and had what I needed in house. I showed up and within 10 minutes had my bike, an emergency  kit (C02 cartridges, tire, tools), and a route map for the area that could be modified to meet my needs. WHAT A RIDE! Ok, so it was not NAPA, but you cannot expect that in the desert. Some great landscapes, some steady elevation gains, some quiet roads, some wildlife (rabbits mainly), and a gorgeous sunny day in March. It just doesn't get much better than that .I cannot rate this place on their tours or their team building, but I will most definitely be back to rent a road bike when I am in the Scottsdale area. I will make sure that I make a reservation in advance, though, since this rare find is likely to leak out ! Cant wait to come back and ride again later in the year!!! Thanks AOA.
My boyfriend and I were looking to rent bikes for a day and The Bicycle Ranch on FLW directed us to Arizona Outback Adventures. Their main business is hikingbiking tours, but I still wanted to review them because they were so friendly and helpful with our little rental! They got us set up with bikes and helmets quickly (each bike was $25 for a few hours). They gave us a map and suggested specific trails that we take and said they would come pick out to help us if we got a flat. Great group of people and excellent customer service. I'd imagine they're great with their toursactivities!
Excellent bike selection, quick in and out, knowledgeable employees on the trails around Scottsdale.  Exact combo I was looking for while on vacation.  Will use again.
This cycle shop rocks.  Quick and friendly service despite my late arrival (my bad).  They had a lot of rental options to choose from.  Recommend this place for rentals.  And they are close to the entrance to the preserve.
I can't say enough good things about this ranch. My sister and I wanted to reconnect and had been to two dude ranches as children. We searched for a small family-run ranch and we found exactly what we wanted.The Flying E Ranch feels exactly like the ranches from the 1960's (except for the hot tub and the ranch store). The place is charmingly decorated and there are many antiques and special touches such as photo albums featuring every guest.Most guests that we met had been there for multiple visits so that is a good recommendation in itself. The staff was charming and service was great. Everyone we met there was nice. There was a happy hour for adults every night which was fun. We are on a vegan diet right now and they accommodated us with perfect entrees at every meal.The desert is beautiful, good bird-watching, hiking, you can see the stars!, the horses were well-behaved, the wranglers took safety very seriously, even the elderly could ride there, you don't have to ride. There are rides twice a day, we did once a day. There are museums, mine tours, lots of day trips, and golf courses in the area. There were other activities such as square dancing!! which I couldn't believe we did but it was a blast. Team penning, lunch rides, etc. I think this is an excellent place for a reunion of family and friends. You can see your loved ones interacting with other people as everyone eats together. There is plenty for kids to do. I played ping pong with some kids. We also had a private kitchen with a fridge (shared with another room). They fill up well in advance so make your plans early.Really.
