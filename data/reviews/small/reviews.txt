Perhaps good product, but really poor service. My wife and I stopped here to purchase a bike rack for our Rav4. We noticed a Rav4 in the parking lot with a bike rack and asked the salesperson (Jim) if he could help us determine if it met some of our criteria (does not cause bike damage to mounted back tire; allows back door to swing open for rear access). Jim was telling us some things that contradicted information I had found online; so we asked if he could help us track down the owner. This was over the top for Jim and he made derogatory comments as he strutted away to hide in the back of the store.  My wife and I tracked down the Rav4 owner on our own and he was more than happy to share his experience and contradict Jim's "guesses" that were portrayed as fact.I had never been in a situation where a sales person abandoned me in a store before; so I contacted the owner (Darren). He apologized and indicated that we would receive a 20% discount on another bike rack that he had in stock and that I believed would meet our needs. I indicated I would think about the purchase offer, but really wanted an apology from the sales person. I was told the offer stood for as long as they had my desired bike rack in stock and that I would receive an apology from Jim. I decided to purchase a rack and followed up twice to make arrangements. Once I was ignored; the other time I was told they'd have to check inventory. I was never able to make arrangements to conclude the sale and never received an apology from the sales person. If you place importance on follow-through and commitment to customer satisfaction, I would suggest you consider other stores in the Madison area. I frequent several other stores that have excellent follow-through and place greater emphasis on customer satisfaction.
Been going here for specialty boat items for 10 years spanning ownership of 4 boats. Ordered something from a VERY helpful gentlemen last Saturday. I got a message the part had arrrived in precisely the time I was told... I show up to an empty store with 2 employees attending to a pallet of product. One asks me if I need help and I explain I'm there to pick up a special order part... He says "OK." and proceeds to put his hands in his pockets and talk to the girl attending to the pallet. 2 min later the girl begins walking towards us and asks my last name... She doesn't here me apparently and borderline yells "WHAT" at me. After repeating, she gets the part, tosses it on the counter, charges me and says, "Thanks" in a smart tone while walking away. Marine Max 1 mile away just got all of my business. You're welcome for a decade worth of business. Too bad you tossed it on a $3.16 part.
This place was a joke we rented 1 jet ski and brought it back with one scratch. I have been waiting over two weeks for him to tell us how much he's going to charge us why they have held our deposit. Hardly picks up Phone never calls back rarely is there.... Looked at all the good reviews thought it was a good place but I've had the worst experience ever.. By far the worst company I've ever dealt with.. Be careful!
We were out at the lake this weekend boating and towed a jet ski rented from Jet Action back to the dock.  Things happen, but when I called the office to help make arrangements for the couple "stuck" in the middle of the lake, I was treated rudely and told that "these things don't break down so I don't know what to tell you."  No suggestions or assistance was offered. I would NOT rent here.  Unhelpful and very rude.
I saw a cockroach here once.  Their ciabatta bread and crepes are almost delicious enough for me to look the other way, but I'm a little too grossed out to ever frequent this place again.
Worst Crepe !!!!!!! Being an European cafe if they don't know how to make a extremely simple Crepe, don't know what to write. We ordered 4 crepes, and they all were bad, uncooked crepe, very little filling. We are having stomach aches as well. Tried calling them and they kept us on hold for over 15 minutes..Weird!!!!  Don't know about other stuff but crepes are HORRIBLE..stay away if you are going there in the hope of a good Crepe as we did....
stop selling  day-old items as fresh and lying about it! c'mon!
I was dismayed by the poor service at the VetMed location.  After purchasing a pricey Roasted Red Pepper w smoked gouda soup, I was handed a cold soup and told to heat it up in the microwave.  Unsanitary and unprofessional.
Me giving one star is gracious. My roommate and I went here tonight. I have been to this restaurant when it was just the sushi room and loved it! However tonight was different. I made a reservation for 630, the hostess asked us to sit at the bar while they prepared the table,and then sat 12 other people at the table before she remembered the two of us. When we sat down we ordered, the waitress took forever to bring the soup which was Luke warm at best and tasted like soapy dish water. The salad didn't come until the chef started making our food. This was good. But as everyone was receiving their fried rice and steamed rice,my roommate and I noticed we had not gotten our steamed rice. We had to ask another waiter for rice.I had new York steak and shrimp. My roomie had chicken and filet mignon. My steak was over cooked I asked for medium rare. Her chicken as well was over cooked. Neither were seasoned barely at all. The shrimp was good tho. Unfortunately after I saw the owner ask a table full of people who were done eating and chatting if they could please move because while they appreciate their business there were people waiting. I knew my complaints would be irrelevant.Needless to say I'm disappointed in the food, the service, all of it. And will never go back for tempanyaki. They have alot of kinks to work out.
Yuck! Specialty rolls were definitely nothing special. Tasted like a packaged California roll you buy in a grocery store. The $9 short ribs were cold and super salty. When I told the waiter all he said was "sorry" and walked off. Maybe the Teppanyaki is better but if you want sushi or hand rolls drive east 10 minutes to Otaku!
Very bad customer service! Look out for the lady ismara behind the counter. She is the wetzel pretzel devil!
I walked up while the manager was cashiering. He was talking.inappropriately about a girl who.asked for an application and made it very awkward when ordering. I dont appreciate sexist people so I'll order from Auntie Anns now.
I was very upset, not with the quality of food but with the quality of management. I witnessed a manager say inappropriate things about a young girl and spoke about Wetzels and how they determine who works there. I'm sorry - but if she bought a pretzel and asked for an app, there's no excuse for rude behavior. Also, before you make snide remarks about customers, you should realize that customers pay your measly salary. Auntie Anns from now on.
Walking through the mall, sometimes you want one of those soft pretzels with dipping sauces they are serving up.On this particular occasion, we ordered the sour cream and onion pretzel with the nacho cheese and salsa dipping sauce, a garlic pretzel with nacho cheese and salsa dipping sauce, and a pretzel dog.I can't remember much else because within 15 minutes of finishing, I was in search of the ladies' room.  Stomach cramps, chills, and the sweats...ran to the toilet and out it went.  Bad cheese, perhaps(I do still visit other pretzel locations when I'm at the mall, this so happens to be the only time I visited this Auntie Anne's location.)
The pretzels didn't look so fresh, and the shift leader has an attitude.
Worst service ever. Buy 2 pretzel and large drink and get free pretzel, and display pretzel cups and don't honor that such false advertisement. Not a happy customer. Then they start arguing and getting defensive. If I could not give a star I would. They need to fix this. Use a pretzel picture instead of the pretzel cup
Just like earlier reviews , I received an attitude and bad service. Don't want to honor my card and after I downloaded my apps, don't want to do it.  If there is a lower star than 1, I'd happily give it to them.
Got this as a gift from Groupon....it was actually alot of fun...we knew we would get our butt kicked by a bunch of 12 year olds....but with that being said....they give you a 10 minute orentation about the rules which all make sense. the people managing the field do nto pay attention and inforce these safety rules. teams are not matched fairly....a bunch of 12 year olds agains a pro team....a guy on the other team stuck the barrell of his fully auto paitball gun under my face mask after he was shot out and shot me in the face. after i was out i proceeded to leave the field with my hands in the air ( as instructed) and the same guy unloaded about 15-20 rounds on me within 5 feet which again is against the rules. i questioned the guy on why he did it and he grabbed me by the shirt and proceeded to instigate a fight.  ALL OF THIS HAPPENED IN FRONT OF A YOUNG BLONDE FEMALE STAFF MEMBER WHO DID NOTHING! the staff didnt do much about this other than appologize and offer me a free visit. they contunued to let the violent gentelman stay and play when he should of been kicked out. there was also a dad and his 3 kids that  questioned the staff about the rules not being followed and they ended up leaving due to carelessness from the staff. needless to say....it would of been a ton of fun if the rules given were monotored. WILL GO TO ANOTHER PAINTBALL FACILITY NEXT TIME.
Absolutely horrible experience. I would give half a star if possible. It is overpriced for the size and style of arena. It is understaffed and unprofessional. I dropped my gun off to get work done and before I left to go to Tempe paintball to pick it up I notified the one employee on staff that I would be coming. When I got there I arrived to a locked door and after calling 17 times, knocking on the door for nearly 15 minutes and standing outside for nearly 20 minutes and leaving 2 voicemails I finally got my gun back. I will never return to Tempe Paintball nor will I ever refer a friend or enemy there... That would just be cruel. If your looking for a good place to go go to Westworld Indoor Paintball. It's a little bit of a drive but WAY more worth your money.
Had a great experience with Frank and his team.  It was our daughter's Sweet 16, and it was perfect.  They walked us through all the things we needed to know, and helped us from the first phone call to the last song.  It really helped to have them reassure us that they would entertain 60 kids, and we didn't have to worry!  The light show is a must.  It took the music to a different level.  I recommend Windy City DJ's for your needs.  Don't be afraid to ask questions, because they've done it all and can help you with a lot of details!
We hired Ray the DJ after extensive dj research for our wedding. There are so many bad djs out there that we wanted to be sure. Ray the DJ has very competitive prices and Brenda who is in the main office is terrific. She answered all of our e-mails quickly and was always very professional. We hired Marcus from Ray and he was awesome!! He meet with us before we even hired him so we could find out about his background and experience. We loved Marcus right away. However, at Ray they give you the chance to choose a different DJ in case you don't "click" with your first DJ. Marcus was very professional and played all the songs we requested and provided us with great suggestions. After the wedding we got so many compliments about our DJ. For any brides out there looking for a great DJ I would highly recommend Ray the DJ and Marcus.
Ray made our wedding reception absolutely phenomenal! He timed all of the little special requests perfectly (like me surprising my husband with a groom's cake). He read the group on the dance floor perfectly and because of that, we didn't stop dancing until our time ran out. He even went along with a surprise our friends had for us that called for a certain song. Could not have imagined that night as perfectly as it turned out. Thank you Ray!
Jeremy at Ray the DJ was simply fantastic. I met with at least 6 other DJs before finding Jeremy. Not only were his prices $250 below all the others, he was friendly, professional, knowledgeable, and went above and beyond to ensure I got what I wanted. He offered several add-ons to my package, but never pushed. He communicated with me regularly and gave suggestions, but never tried to steer me away from the music and vision I had for my reception. I loathe the cheesy DJ thing, and he was the epitome of class and professionalism. My guests danced the entire time, and that is the true mark of a great DJ. You will NOT be disappointed with Jeremy at Ray the DJ!
The decision on the DJ for our wedding was made the moment we met with Jeff from Ray the DJ.  He is older for a man of his profession (not a kid in his 20's that you'd expect to be working as a partyevent DJ) but it didn't take long for him to win us over.  The man is all charm and character.  We could tell that he really loved music and what he does.  I almost wanted to pull him out from behind the turntables, sit down, and have a few drinks with him. He couldn't have been any better at the reception.  He played everything we asked for, flowed perfectly with our timeline (including working with us to finish some schmoozing before moving on to the next part), He could get our guest's attention but never tried to make himself the star of the show, and he knew how to keep the party going.  The only negative thing I can say about Jeff was that he took an awful request from my new sister in law (but in all fairness to him, she wanted to dance with her husband to their wedding song, so I can't blame him), but he quickly recovered as soon as the track ended.  Probably with the exception of that song, people were on the dance floor until the final song.
For our wedding, we were very wary about DJ's because we had been to many wedding where the DJ absolutely sucked.....well not this company!Our DJ was Mike, and he was awesome! We met two or three times prior to the wedding just to go over everything, and Mike made sure that he had all the correct info. My dad STILL says how great he was, and our wedding was over 2 months ago! We constantly heard how great he was from many ages of our guests. I would recommend this company to anyone looking for a good time.Mike also was the MC for the wedding, and he did a great job! No complaints in any way at all! Their website is also very very helpful when it comes to picking songs. We weren't picky about songs, and chose to trust him when it came to the music, and boy are we happy we did that! Like i said before, everyone loved him!!! Great job Ray the DJ!
Chad is amazing! Working with him was more enjoyable than I thought working with a DJ could be! He made the entire process a breeze from initial consultation to our Last Dance. Chad has a unique and amazing ability to read a crowd and energize a group in just the right way to ensure each guest feels included in each moment of your event. Chad embraced our non-traditional song choices and offered valuable suggestions during our planning to make our event extra special. With Chad, you're not just getting a DJ - you're gaining a fun, fresh, funky friend who will masterfully guide each moment of your special day to make sure that it reflects you're vision and personality - as well as that of your guests, and infuses both into the greatest party you'll ever experience! Chad lays out the planning process in easy to follow worksheets and provides a wealth of suggestions, both on paper and in person, to make sure you are able to craft an event that reflects energy, enjoyment, and personality from beginning to end. I would recommend working with Chad on any event where you're looking for an experienced and talented master to be your Director of Fun!
I can go on and on about Chad!  I can guarantee that he'll be the best DJ you'll ever work with!  We hired him for our st. pattys day wedding this past year and our guests are still talking about how much fun they had on our day.  If you want a creative, fun, not typical wedding entertainment,  Chad will be your guy!  He has many ideas to make your day fun and stress free.  When we first met him, right off the bat you could tell he is a very professional, organized, yet a kind hearted guy.  So easy to work with that you'll want to plan another event so you could hire him again.  We miss our day and the entertainment made our wedding day so memorable!
My husband and I used SKM for our wedding DJ, MC, and videography.  We were thoroughly impressed with their professionalism, timeliness, and organization during the planning.  They were always one step ahead of us and made everything so easy for us.  We loved our MC, Chris.  He was very friendly and attentive to what we wanted at our reception.  He really took control, and we were worry free all night.  He kept checking in to see if I needed anything, which was very nice.  All the guests had a wonderful time at the wedding.  He had everyone on the dance floor and no one wanted to stop dancing.  The DJ, Gavin, did a great job with the music! I highly recommend both of them for your event.  We also booked our videography, David, for a great price.  We are waiting to get the video, but know it will come out great.  He stayed the whole time and even interviewed my grandparents.  I can't wait to see it.  Thank you SKM for making our night go so smoothly.  You took great care of us, and we got to just enjoy the night, our family, and friends.  Thank you!!
These wonderful people did our wedding this past March and I just have to say it was an absolute joy and pleasure to work with them! Miles and his group were very accommodating and the flow of the wedding was fantastic. We had people come from all over and my cousins in Florida commented how great of a time it truly was! I couldn't be more happy. And to see my wife's face throughout it all...that was my joy. Thank you so much to these great people! I like how they were always consulting with us and kept it stress free. Pricing was perfect and spot on. We were able to pick and choose a custom package and the sound was awesome. It was the best I've ever seen and I would have no problem referring these good people to anyone!
SKM was one of the best choices we made for our wedding.  I was worried when first selecting them because they are a bit pricey, but after meeting Nathan at a bridal show, I was intrigued enough to set up a consultation.  My husband and I were immediately impressed with how thorough they were in the planning process and booked them despite the cost.  It was totally worth it. Nathan (our MC) was super helpful with all of my planning questions throughout the process, even answering annoying texts from me the week of the wedding with last minute questions.  He offered great suggestions for timelines and songs for events.  The event itself was spectacularly run. The two-person team was flawless.  All of the transitions from tradition to tradition were well handled.  They coordinated with all of the other vendors well and with the guests.  Nathan consistently checked in with us to make sure we were having a good time.  He was involved with our guests, asking them what they wanted to hear and actually playing those songs (My uncle leapt out of his seat when Brick House, his choice, came on).   Nathan learned important people's names and used them at the wedding.  He involved guests at all stages so there was never a dull moment.  He even got out on the dance floor and taught guests the wobble.  Our guests raved about SKM and their experience.  SKM definitely made our wedding unforgettable for us and all of our guests.
Skm rocks! Very organized and professional. Nathan was amazing as our MC! I would recommend this company to anyone for any event! We'll done.
Jimmy D with Starz Entertainment did a fantastic job providing us DJ services for our wedding and reception. Jimmy D has a great and well-deserved reputation in the DJ community. We are lucky we were able to hire him to DJ our wedding and reception. He has many years of experience and it shows. He was energetic and super professional in every aspect of the planning and execution of our wedding and reception. He answered our emails immediately and met with us several times before the wedding to make sure we had everything set up the way we wanted. He spent hours before and after, setting up to make sure the lighting and sound was the best it could be. He had great suggestions for songs and activities and helped make our wedding and reception absolutely perfect. It was seamless, and everyone had a great time! We highly, highly, recommend Jimmy D and Starz Entertainment for DJ services!
Jimmy D is the best DJ that you will find in Arizona! I attended a wedding that he DJed and he did such a great job that I booked him when I got married 4 years later! He gets everyone up and dancing, there wasn't a single person in the room who wasn't dancing once Jimmy opened the dance floor! He is so fun, charismatic, and extremely professional. I highly recommend anyone who is looking for someone to entertain guests of all ages, who can control the energy of the room, and who is easy and delightful to work with!
Jimmy did an absolute amazing job as our wedding DJ. It's the only wedding I have ever seen where the dance floor was PACKED all night long. Not only was his playlist amazing, his ability to keep everything organized and on track was very key. We actually didn't have a wedding planner, and without Jimmy there to basically run the show, I'm not sure what we would've done. His assistant Carie was awesome as well. She played a really key role in keeping everything up to speed and organized. We would highly recommend Jimmy and Starz Entertainment!  SUPER IMPRESSED!!!!!
Fun for Everyone! My daughter had a softball tournament here and the facilities are awsome! They have everything you could ask for out of a community park. For example, softballbaseball fields, batting cages, skate park, rec center gym, sand volleyball courts, splash pad, and they even have a few fishing ponds for those wanting to relax. I also saw that they had teen dodgeball tournament going on in their rec center. They probably have some more stuff to do there that I didnt get a chance to check out cause this place is huge! They have a baseball store and a Starbucks also! Very cool place.
While at Birds n' Beer last Thursday, I learned what "riparian zone" means. It is the strip between land and stream or lake. (Cue the "The More  You Know" clip)The center itself is beautiful and great for a small - medium sized event. Lots of modern architecture and what looks like reclaimed materials. It's an eco-friendly building with great native landscaping.Now to the real part of the review: Bird and Beer is a great event, if you are free on a Thursday night between 5:30p and 7:30p. 5:30 to 6:30 is a chattingsnackingdrinking time with Four Peaks beer in a can. The lecture starts at 6:30 and is very informative. This month was reptile sex and last month was bird sex. The events are usually listed on the events section of Yelp, so check it out now.The Center is easy to find. It is just south of the river on Central, with a sign posted on the road pointing towards the building and the parking lot.
My trip should have been aptly called "Beards and Beer" instead of the "birds n beers."  Apparently I missed out on the typical "sex" themed talks, IE. frog sex, bird sex and flower sex.  Since this was the last event of the year, visitors got a stand up routine about beards from an official Beardo.  Wildly funny and entertaining stand up, the Four Peaks beer might have helped.  Four Peaks provided their main staple beers: Kilt lifter, Hop Knot and Kolsch.  3 styles to meet any palate.  Stop by and you'll meet their passionate staff and some friendly bird n beer enthusiasts.  There's no better way to to unwind after work, and learn a few things about that nature thing outside.
Phoenix is one of only 6 cities to get a center like this. They've taken a derelict parcel of ground and converted it into something beautiful and sustainable. Every time I go I see some special bird or bug that I haven't seen before. The River Pathways program is amazing and available to kids who might otherwise not get an experience like this.
Excellent bike selection, quick in and out, knowledgeable employees on the trails around Scottsdale.  Exact combo I was looking for while on vacation.  Will use again.
This cycle shop rocks.  Quick and friendly service despite my late arrival (my bad).  They had a lot of rental options to choose from.  Recommend this place for rentals.  And they are close to the entrance to the preserve.
I can't say enough good things about this ranch. My sister and I wanted to reconnect and had been to two dude ranches as children. We searched for a small family-run ranch and we found exactly what we wanted.The Flying E Ranch feels exactly like the ranches from the 1960's (except for the hot tub and the ranch store). The place is charmingly decorated and there are many antiques and special touches such as photo albums featuring every guest.Most guests that we met had been there for multiple visits so that is a good recommendation in itself. The staff was charming and service was great. Everyone we met there was nice. There was a happy hour for adults every night which was fun. We are on a vegan diet right now and they accommodated us with perfect entrees at every meal.The desert is beautiful, good bird-watching, hiking, you can see the stars!, the horses were well-behaved, the wranglers took safety very seriously, even the elderly could ride there, you don't have to ride. There are rides twice a day, we did once a day. There are museums, mine tours, lots of day trips, and golf courses in the area. There were other activities such as square dancing!! which I couldn't believe we did but it was a blast. Team penning, lunch rides, etc. I think this is an excellent place for a reunion of family and friends. You can see your loved ones interacting with other people as everyone eats together. There is plenty for kids to do. I played ping pong with some kids. We also had a private kitchen with a fridge (shared with another room). They fill up well in advance so make your plans early.Really.
