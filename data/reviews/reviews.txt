Perhaps good product, but really poor service. My wife and I stopped here to purchase a bike rack for our Rav4. We noticed a Rav4 in the parking lot with a bike rack and asked the salesperson (Jim) if he could help us determine if it met some of our criteria (does not cause bike damage to mounted back tire; allows back door to swing open for rear access). Jim was telling us some things that contradicted information I had found online; so we asked if he could help us track down the owner. This was over the top for Jim and he made derogatory comments as he strutted away to hide in the back of the store.  My wife and I tracked down the Rav4 owner on our own and he was more than happy to share his experience and contradict Jim's "guesses" that were portrayed as fact.I had never been in a situation where a sales person abandoned me in a store before; so I contacted the owner (Darren). He apologized and indicated that we would receive a 20% discount on another bike rack that he had in stock and that I believed would meet our needs. I indicated I would think about the purchase offer, but really wanted an apology from the sales person. I was told the offer stood for as long as they had my desired bike rack in stock and that I would receive an apology from Jim. I decided to purchase a rack and followed up twice to make arrangements. Once I was ignored; the other time I was told they'd have to check inventory. I was never able to make arrangements to conclude the sale and never received an apology from the sales person. If you place importance on follow-through and commitment to customer satisfaction, I would suggest you consider other stores in the Madison area. I frequent several other stores that have excellent follow-through and place greater emphasis on customer satisfaction.
Been going here for specialty boat items for 10 years spanning ownership of 4 boats. Ordered something from a VERY helpful gentlemen last Saturday. I got a message the part had arrrived in precisely the time I was told... I show up to an empty store with 2 employees attending to a pallet of product. One asks me if I need help and I explain I'm there to pick up a special order part... He says "OK." and proceeds to put his hands in his pockets and talk to the girl attending to the pallet. 2 min later the girl begins walking towards us and asks my last name... She doesn't here me apparently and borderline yells "WHAT" at me. After repeating, she gets the part, tosses it on the counter, charges me and says, "Thanks" in a smart tone while walking away. Marine Max 1 mile away just got all of my business. You're welcome for a decade worth of business. Too bad you tossed it on a $3.16 part.
This place was a joke we rented 1 jet ski and brought it back with one scratch. I have been waiting over two weeks for him to tell us how much he's going to charge us why they have held our deposit. Hardly picks up Phone never calls back rarely is there.... Looked at all the good reviews thought it was a good place but I've had the worst experience ever.. By far the worst company I've ever dealt with.. Be careful!
We were out at the lake this weekend boating and towed a jet ski rented from Jet Action back to the dock.  Things happen, but when I called the office to help make arrangements for the couple "stuck" in the middle of the lake, I was treated rudely and told that "these things don't break down so I don't know what to tell you."  No suggestions or assistance was offered. I would NOT rent here.  Unhelpful and very rude.
JET ACTION RENTALS destroyed my view on small Arizona business and tarnished my dreams of enjoying a great relaxing "staycation" with my family at the lake.  Today JET ACTION RENTALS stole my money and left me down creek without a paddle. Ive spent five years at war fighting for this country and the small business in it only to come home and find out the real terrorists have been here the whole time. Setting up shady businesses to take advantage of the hard working American people by stealing their money. I do not recommend this "ESTABLISHMENT", for the absence of a better word, to anybody that holds any respect for the values of small business. They lack trust, justice, dignity, and dependability.My family and I were passing by their establishment when we decided to swing in and try to get a fun toy to help us relax at the lake. The man that helped us pulled a number out of his hat on what we would pay. He said "$100 for the first day $175 for the next two." Skeptical of our deal we asked to see a price book or any paperwork at all but the business had nothing to show us. We asked what the cancelation process is and he went on to tell us that "as long as we canceled before the 48 hours prior to picking up the jet ski it would be a full refund." He said he needed my driver license and a credit card to hold the watercraft. He then took my cards and placed them out of my sight and logged all my info into an IPAD to be stored. He gave me my cards back and walked me out the front door telling me I can come back Thursday to collect my rentals.  Skeptical of the whole ordeal I had a friend call the establishment 20mins after I left to price out what it would cost him to rent the same days and the same equipment. He was told nearly $30 more each day. I decided to call around and check group on only to find that every other business was much cheaper to rent from and groupon had some jetskis going for as low as $85 a day.  I called JET ACTION back with in one hour of being at the store to tell him that I was going to go a different direction and would like to cancel my request to rent. He informed me that the deposit I spent to hold the reservation was Non-refundable and he said  "it belongs to me now!" I told him that I had no idea about that and even specifically asked before I put money down if I would receive a full refund, to which he replied, "YES." He told me that that part of the agreement was emailed to me after we did our deal. I did get an email from him after I called telling me that it was non-refundable, but signed or saw nothing during purchase.
This place sucks and they lie.My nephew and his bride were here from England and my wedding gift for them was a day out on the like with jet skis.I called on Saturday sept 8th and got some Aussie guy on the phone who took my reservation for 2 jet skis the following morning at 8am, and also took my credit card info.When we arrived at 8 am the guy in the shop had no idea about our reservation. He had to call the Aussie guy, who then must have remembered me from the night before. Well it was raining on that morning and boulder highway had a section closed due to a marathon race. So the guy in the shop told me that they were not renting that day due to the fact that lake mead was closed.I'd never heard of this before, but I was disappointed and left. My nephew and his bride were upset, but we moved on. I then saw a cop, by the closed section of the highway and asked him if lake mead was in fact closed. He said no and there were two other alternate routes to get there.So this skiwi rental place flat out lied to us. I ended up renting a couple of high powered skis from their competition who couldn't believe they did that to us, and he gave us a discount. Go with vegas jet ski rental. Much more professional and don't lie to their customers and tell them the lake is closed.Btw, the weather got beautiful later that day and we all had the best day.
So my husband and I had our out drive done there a year and a half ago. Long story short and 2700 bucks later.. There are several opinions, including my husbands (a former mechanic) that the boot was not securely fastened and therefore leaked. We are long time boaters and our last out drive lasted 13 years and is now happily serving someone else. This almost took out the entire unit and it was saved and now runs better than ever by another mechanic for a mere 900! Thank heavens. These guys were sadly typical. They always had a new excuse to charge us more.. And that would be fine if they did the job, but the service was poor quality! Save yourself grief and go to Gerry's Marine instead, he's awesome! Thanks Gerry!
We have talked to you Candice and your Dad (if that's what you'd call it). No changes to my review. It takes a lot to get me to the point of writing a good or bad review. I won't bore everyone with all the details.
Don't come here for parts, they charge 2x as much, try the Internet, you save money in the long run. Supposed to be zero star but I have to put one to post  my review.
I second the review that complained about lack of availability on weekends. My sister came to visit me from overseas and the only time I would be able to go out with them is on a weekend. Guess what, all their weekends are booked for the next 3 months! Who goes on a full day boat trip during the week  I have contacted Groupon and asked for a refund. They better refund me my money back or I am disputing the charge with my credit card company! Never buy a Groupon with this company unless you plan on going on a weekday or can plan a boat trip 3 months in advance!
MUST READ AND FOREWARNEDHere's the story:Beware of the damage repair profit racket the marina operators are running with their rental products (i.e. jetski's and boats).  To begin with, the owner's son (~20'ish) is in training to run the jetski rental business (which operates separately from the boat rental business for separation of liability purposes...now I know why), but all owned by the same people.  His only concern during talking you down (yes, talking you down like you're a kid yourself) through the rental and operation process is that, "if you break it, you pay for it".  He knows every penalty cost down to the cent (down to the scratch repair cost per inch!!!) and is sure to let you know that, but 1) conveniently fails to mention how to avoid rolling these things over (which we learned is at a very low speed; i.e. less than 5 mph).  2) again, conveniently enough, he fails to instruct on how to roll the machine back if you do happen to roll it.  It turns out it takes a bypassing boater to tell you how to roll it over, and lastly, 3) no mention at all of safety measures.  No care for their liability in case someone should get hurt out there where boats are racing by.  The owner even agreed with me this piece of instruction was missing and that he'd talk with his son.Now to the fun part.My 10 year old son and I roll this thing upon coming to a stop.  Turns out the machine was apparently under water by about a minute too long due primarily to their lack of instruction to a first time rider.  Had to get it towed to the marina by the nice boaters who rescued us after we weren't able to roll up right side up because we were going against the weight (i.e. left to right and not right to left...again, would have been good to know and the thing would have been rolled back within seconds and would have avoided taking on too much water).  Story continues, getting back to the marina was a threat filled experience with the most pessimistic stance that this thing is ruined, etc.  Talk about taking a brow-beating and the implicit threat from his goons of "you're not leaving here without a credit card charged for this"!  IT'S A WATER CRAFT that took on some water, people!!!  Now, it turns out they claim they had to take the craft down to a jetski repair place in Phoenix and that repair turned out to be no more than $500.  We know the owner of the repair place and he informed us of the root cause of why the machine was not running optimally.  Apparently, it needed some kind of a fiber credit card sized fuel valve.  I wouldn't doubt the marina "mechanic" who doubles as the deck hand and general employee broke this part (because he dug into the machine himself according to the owner of the marina) to cause the need for repair.  So, here's the next kicker.  The owner, has charged $1,014 for the repair!  According to him, his guys spent time digging into the machine and who knows what else he threw in there.  His deck hand is already on the clock!!!  I can assure you Monday's are not busy to where we have to factor in an opportunity cost.  So, this is where it becomes a profit making scheme.  Lure people with Groupons and Deal Chickens, conveniently avoid explaining the real important things to first time riders, have the machine damaged, and now the repair place (unnamed) in Phoenix AND the marina operators all profit.  Do the math.  We went from renting the boat on a Groupon for $140 for the day (and only used half day) and $75 for the jetski (Deal Chicken) to have a charge of an additional $1014 for a grand total of $1229 for one of the worse customer service experiences we have ever had.  So, in summary.  A seemingly profit making scheme run by some of the worst customer service goons (and whoever their profiteering service partners are) that ends up costing a boat load (no pun intended) of money.  I think I'll stick to golf.----------------------------------------------------------------------------Aug 17, 2012:  Update -  I feel it's only fair to update the above review on the amount that was charged.  My credit card company had told me the final charges were the $1014.  However, the marina subsequently emailed me the final bill of $495, but waited two weeks to notify me so one starts to assume.  So, that's a much different perspective regarding the charges.  Although, there had been talk early on about adding in some 'overhead charges' above their normal wage for the amount of time his deck guys spent on it.  The rest of the situation, however, remains where there was no instruction on how to keep the machine from rolling over and how to get it back right-side-up.----------------------------------------------------------------------------Oct 22, 2012: Update - After discussions with the owner of the Marina, we have gracefully settled on the charges in a mutually acceptable manner without hassle.  Thank you.
Unless you've been here before, let me warn you about the "unspoken house rules": 1. Order first (do not try and sit down).2. Wait for your food while standing.3. Find a seat (if one is available).Under no circumstances should you sit down before placing an order. And if the place is full, don't try and sit down without food in your hands, unless you want to be made an example of.My wife and I (who frequent restaurants several times a week) have never experienced anyone quite as rude as the woman behind the counter at this place.  We had never been here before and when we walked in, my wife sat down at a table and I went up to place our order.Little did I know the house rules (see above) and after the people in front of me ordered, the obnoxious cashier pointed to our table and to another table (of newbies) and said to the person who just placed the order: "you can either sit there or there", with the tact of, say, General Patton. She never asked us to get up or explained the "unwritten rules" to us.  An "excuse me, but you need to order first before you sit down" would have sufficed.So, my wife got up and we walked out of this place. The food could very well be good - but with waitstaff like this woman - there are plentty of other places around town with not-so crummy service that I'd prefer to spend my money.
The crepes served by this establishment might very well be the culinary embodiment of a mind-exploding, toe-curling, orgasm.  I say, "might be" because on my recent (and last) trip there I didn't have an opportunity to sample them.  In fact, I didn't eat anything at all.Please let me explain.The restaurant is located in the basement of a building off of Walnut Street.  Customers are expected to wait in a line that stretches from the entrance, through the main dining area, to a counter where the crepes are ordered and cooked.  It's a horrendous setup for multiple reasons.  First, there aren't many tables.  When I went there on a Saturday morning, there were at least 20 people standing in line for the ten or so small tables.  Second, the restaurant expects you to wait in line, standing next to tables of patrons who are eating their food, until a table becomes free.  At that point, the woman at the counter takes the next order, a man begins preparing the crepes, and the front of the line is seated while everyone else continues to wait.  Those who have waited long enough, are finally able to sit, while hungry and impatient diners-to-be stand next to their table and wait some more.It's a horrible atmosphere, and not one conducive to a pleasant dining experience.The dining space is poorly designed, so that the line of waiting patrons snakes directly though the middle of the cramped dining area.  Which means that when you are waiting, you are continually bumped by servers shuttling food to the tables and dirty dishes back to the kitchen.  When you are eating, you are likely to: 1) have a bunch of hungry people staring at you eat, waiting for you to leave your table, so that they may be seated; andor 2) have a standing person's ass within a few inches of your head.  What a great dining atmosphere!What's all the more annoying is the lackadaisical work ethic of the people who prepare the crepes.  More than once during my wait, the man making the crepes just stood around, not making any food, waiting for another table to open, so a party's order could be taken, and he could then prepare the next order.  After waiting 15-20 minutes while hungry, becoming increasingly annoyed at being bumped at least 2 dozen times by serves traversing the line, and then seeing the owner stop making food until another order was taken, I said to myself, "enough of this nonsense".My party and I left to go to another restaurant.  I've not eaten any crepe in the world that would justify a long wait under such annoying circumstances, and I will not be back.
Closed on Monday's And closed 530 to 61 Wow. The prices on the menu don't seem that bad. But i still cant get over the fact there closed on Mondays. There is a sign posted "help wanted" so if anyone reads this and needs a job check this place out. And tell them to open on Mondays. BOOOOO, if they weren't closed I would have never found Square Cafe.
Pompous manager hung up on me twice (!) when I called to ask about wait times.  Have never boycotted a restaurant until now.  Mediocre crepes don't entitle that sort of bush league behavior!
this place is an absolute joke. it's extremely overpriced ($12 for a solo ham and cheese crepe you have got to be kidding me), the menu is extremely limited, and the food is just plain not up to par. seriously--if you're going to try to make a place 'hip' or upscale and charge those kinds of prices, you've got to make the experience worth it. i honestly don't know what the people raving about this place are talking about when it comes to the most delicious food they've ever had. the crepe i had was waaaay too salty, and their bloody marys tasted like they were made of pickle juice. neither i nor the person i was dining with were impressed, and, needless to say, we won't be showing up again.
If you are looking for good authentic french food or a luxurious treat (as it should be with such ridiculous prices) you should stay far far away from Carmon's. This place definitely tries way too hard to be something its not. If not for prior knowledge of this place I would've classified it as a diner. Don't be confused by the menus (which are on shitty clipboards for some reason..) as a high price usually denotes high quality. This is not the case here. The ratatouille was one of the worst my gf has ever had, it tasted like dirt. You pay something like $20 for a pancake filled with questionable meat cooked in a microwave. The one thing that was good was the Crepe Suzette. It was a little too sweet but was a pleasant surprise after a meal of such low quality. The one thing that really pissed off our whole party and ruined the experience was the service. I have never seen a restaurant that hires waitresses this horrible. I mean the service we received was worse than even shitty diners on local highways.  First off, when we went in there were only 2 tables occupied other than us, and we went in with a party of 5. We were not given the large table for some reason, I guess they wanted to save it for parties of 6 or more, but there were very few people in the restaurant and it was way past the normal dinner time. The waitress pushed together one regular sized 2 person table and one small 2 person table designed for cocktails and such. The two tables didn't even fit the same length and there were two giant corners sticking out in the middle of our party. We were placed in the corner of the restaurant too. Its fine to save larger tables for larger parties but at 5 people we could definitely take up the 6 person table. Also there were almost no other guests in the restaurant so we felt pretty unimportant to be forced to sit on two childlike tables. The waitress also didn't serve us water at all but rather just threw down a giant water jug and told us to refill it ourselves. She then disappeared for the entire meal and came back only for the check. Now heres the good part: When the check came we felt like the mandatory 18% gratuity was unreasonable since we didn't know about it before and also we didn't feel like the service we received deserved any gratuity at all. When we told this to our waitress she totally flipped out and said (I quote), "Well we don't need your business then, go eat somewhere else, whatever" and stormed off into the kitchen. We asked for the manager nicely and he eventually came out, but it seemed like he was more annoyed than friendly. It took forever for him to come out since he was obviously hearing the waitress talk about us before coming in. He made some excuses and eventually offered us a discount on our next time back. Thanks but no thanks. We refuse to come to Carmon's ever again. We left the discount card on the table.
This place is not there anymore.
My mom drove me all the way over there yesterday and it wasn't there.  We should have checked Yelp first.  I looked on their website and it looks like there aren't any in Arizona anymore. My mom was very disappointed.
This place was pretty bad. We got the nutella, fruits du mer, peanut butter & bananas, and the mixed berry crepes. The only one that was good was the peanut butter. I think a lot had to do the poor quality of the ingredients. Would not go back.
Ok so I have eaten many crepes in my life being born in Paris and all. So I wasn't expecting much from this place. But my oh my how much below par this place was. I ordered the St. Louise and the bf got the Fruits de la mer. Both of our crepes took over 10 mins to make, and when we got it they were both semi cold...mildly warm in the middle. My crepe was drenched in the bechamel sauce which had like no taste. The actual crepe itself was very flour-ie tasting. The deli ham and cheese helped the food go down. My bf did not enjoy his crepe one bit...what a dissapointment. Also savory crepe should never be the same price as dessert crepes (8.99). Stay away.
Getting a quick breakfast on "The Strip" can be a bit challenging if you aren't looking for a full-service restaurant. That's why I was excited to learn about La Creperie.I ordered the Bayonne with "imported prosciutto, mozzarella, fresh basil, top with bechamel." After a surprisingly long wait, out came a folded crepe with HUGE chunks of incredibly, overpoweringly salty prosciutto inside, a small amount of melted cheese, and a few sprinkles of shredded basil on top.I love salty food, but I could barely handle the massive amount of salty prosciutto in the crepe, especially compared with the mere token amount of barely basil. And the bechamel was just an added layer of gross.Epic fail.
Crepes are pricey and super bland not savory at all...
Awful! I just wanted a basic sugar crepe like the ones I had at the corner stands in Paris. 10 dollars for this basic item that cost two dollars in Paris. I paid it with a smile thinking it'd remind me of the delicious ones in France. Not even close. Overly dry, and the guys serving it appeared miserable.
EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!worst crepe ever!! i got the standard nutella with berriescream....it was disgusting!
This crepe is positively creepy. Burnt, hard around the edges, veggies in middle were cold.  They are so busy they don't care. Concept is good but they definitely new quality control based upon the other positive reviews.
My boyfriend and I were craving something sweet and small so we decided to come to this tiny shack place. We ordered Bayonne and Napoleon Dessert Crepes. Portion is good to share with one person. Personally I rather have ice cream Crepes than just fruit Crepes. I don't like savory Crepes because it tastes weird. It's like eating something hot fruits. Well the reason why I don't like the Bayonne is because the pork tasted funny and it was full of cheese. A little too much cheese for me. For $8.99, I'd rather just get something else like a slice of cheese pizza. The person who took our order was kinda rude. (not to us, but to the people in front of us) The family in front of us doesn't speak English, so they didn't know how to order. They had a difficult time pronouncing the name of the dish and the cashier was rolling his eyes and rushing them. How rude...I wouldn't come back.
This was the worst crepe place I've been to. The crepe was overpriced. The crepe itself was really rubbery. They used frozen fruits instead of canned fruits and the whipped cream they supposedly made themselves were awful. In addition to the crappy crepe, the cashier was rude and didn't tell me my crepe was ready and had left it just sitting at the counter when it was made.
Wasn't like it used to be. I had the nutella crepe. It was crispy instead of soft and pillowy. I'm surprised to say that there was too much nutella to crepe ratio. Banana was fresh. Whipped cream was awesome as before. It's not the same as it used to be.
i've been here twice.  this place is confused.  my 12 year old son was totally unimpressed after they completely screwed up what he ordered.  the staff are maybe too focused on the whole hippie schtick to realize that paying customers don't really care about the staff's identities and really just expect to get what they pay for.if you need a coffee andor food, walk around the corner to kopi.
I saw a cockroach here once.  Their ciabatta bread and crepes are almost delicious enough for me to look the other way, but I'm a little too grossed out to ever frequent this place again.
Worst Crepe !!!!!!! Being an European cafe if they don't know how to make a extremely simple Crepe, don't know what to write. We ordered 4 crepes, and they all were bad, uncooked crepe, very little filling. We are having stomach aches as well. Tried calling them and they kept us on hold for over 15 minutes..Weird!!!!  Don't know about other stuff but crepes are HORRIBLE..stay away if you are going there in the hope of a good Crepe as we did....
stop selling  day-old items as fresh and lying about it! c'mon!
I was dismayed by the poor service at the VetMed location.  After purchasing a pricey Roasted Red Pepper w smoked gouda soup, I was handed a cold soup and told to heat it up in the microwave.  Unsanitary and unprofessional.
hardly authentic, the food is decent, the staff are rude and completely lacking knowledge of what exactly a real crepe is.  Actually the chef as well.
Crepes are overpriced and disgusting.  It was like $9 for a crepe that was filled with nothing.  Service was non-existant.
I was going to eat there. While I was choosing what to order, and after my wife had sat at the table, we were asked to leave the table for someone else.Meanwhile there were plenty of people sitting at their tables talking over empty plates. They have double standards. We left the place and are not thinking of going there anytime soon.
I had high hopes for this restaurant when I walked in. It has the typical decorations of any hibachisushi place and it was nice, but the food.... I ordered a spicy salmon roll (the Mt. Washington roll) and it was just salmon and rice, regardless of what the menu stated and had no flavor at all. I also ordered a rainbow roll that was also lacking. Apparently the server thought I said salmon roll, not rainbow roll and proceeded to make me feel like a jerk for wanting what I actually ordered. The sushi is bland and tasteless and to tpo it off, I got sick after. As much as I really would love a new sushi place in my neighborhood, I'll be going to ones further away. Skip it and head to Sushi Too on Walnut Street, you will be much happier overall.
I had high hopes. I got delivery and specified no shellfish and a different soup. I know they read this because I got the different soup that I asked for. HOWEVER, my sashimi appetizer came with a giant shrimp on top and my chicken hibachi came with shrimp as well. Wha!This was through Wheel Deliver and they fully reimbursed me. This is dangerously irresponsible and I'm, luckily, not allergic.
Changing one's name does not change the fact that the establishment still exists. I've experienced the WORST service with "The Sushi Room" now Rock Lobster. I purchased a Groupon a few months back to eat sushi with my daughter and that is where the horrible service saga began.Making reservations is an absolute joke! When I first purchased the Groupon, we made the reservation as required in the fine print. We arrived 15 mins early and sat outside. 15 mins later our drink orders were taken. Another 10, the drinks arrive and we order. We sat outside for 45 mins with NO food and no real service. The restaurant was NOT crowded! When I requested to cancel the order and pay for the drink I drank, I was told my food was almost ready. Not quite, I'm leaving! We were offered the food for free, but by this time I was quite upset because I was hungry and irritated. Stuck with the Groupon, I was forced to use it before it expired. Thanks for nothing Chase Bank!Today, I had my mother call and make a reservation for 5:30 pm and she was told they only had a 5:45 pm open. Upon arrival at 5:35 pm we were told that we had no reservation. Hmmm. Really! Why is this the same girl who provided no service the last visit And why does the sign on the wall state that Teppan ressy's start at 5 pm Could the night get any worse Hmmm, let's see:- With the addition of the Teppan, the waitress should ask whether or not a guest wants a regular or Teppan seat. Don't automatically walk me to a tray table (too small for 2 people). I made a reservation for the Teppan table that apparently NEVER made it to the book- You have happy hour, but I could only get HH drinks at the Teppanyaki table. Suggestion: Make a special "Teppan HH Menu". This might serve your business well- No real Vodka or decent beer options; at least not for me. Absolute Vodka and Bud Light are low budget. Step up your game- While it is restaurant week, I had to request the RW menu. No bueno- We were told we could sit anywhere at the Teppan table however, should more people arrive we'd have to move down. Great! Right when my a$$ has warmed the seat. Though Benihana's has gone downhill, this place could learn something. Seat people correctly the first time. I'M NOT GETTING UP ONCE I'M COMFORTABLE!NOTE: I actually saw her ask a family with a disabled child to move once others arrived. Rude and unprofessional. The family was there first and shouldn't have been asked to move. If anything, the incoming family of six should've been sat at the Teppan table in the back.- The waitress barely came to inquire if we were ok or if we needed anything. And being the nice person I am, still left a tip. Shame on me.- And last but not least, when I showed her the Groupon she went to touch my phone. (Excuse me! You're in my personal space and attempting to touch my personal property! No bueno!) I will mark the Groupon as redeemed. Don't ever touch a customer's phone. BUYER BEWARE! NEW NAME SAME OWNERS (APPARENTLY) AND SAME WAITRESSES, WHICH IS HARD TO TELL WITHOUT THE CHANGE IN SERVER ATTIRE (FROM BOOTY SHORTS TO BLACK PANTS AND A BLACK UNIFORM T-SHIRT)....THE ONLY THING THIS PLACE DID RIGHT. NEVER AGAIN!
Me giving one star is gracious. My roommate and I went here tonight. I have been to this restaurant when it was just the sushi room and loved it! However tonight was different. I made a reservation for 630, the hostess asked us to sit at the bar while they prepared the table,and then sat 12 other people at the table before she remembered the two of us. When we sat down we ordered, the waitress took forever to bring the soup which was Luke warm at best and tasted like soapy dish water. The salad didn't come until the chef started making our food. This was good. But as everyone was receiving their fried rice and steamed rice,my roommate and I noticed we had not gotten our steamed rice. We had to ask another waiter for rice.I had new York steak and shrimp. My roomie had chicken and filet mignon. My steak was over cooked I asked for medium rare. Her chicken as well was over cooked. Neither were seasoned barely at all. The shrimp was good tho. Unfortunately after I saw the owner ask a table full of people who were done eating and chatting if they could please move because while they appreciate their business there were people waiting. I knew my complaints would be irrelevant.Needless to say I'm disappointed in the food, the service, all of it. And will never go back for tempanyaki. They have alot of kinks to work out.
Yuck! Specialty rolls were definitely nothing special. Tasted like a packaged California roll you buy in a grocery store. The $9 short ribs were cold and super salty. When I told the waiter all he said was "sorry" and walked off. Maybe the Teppanyaki is better but if you want sushi or hand rolls drive east 10 minutes to Otaku!
Very bad customer service! Look out for the lady ismara behind the counter. She is the wetzel pretzel devil!
I walked up while the manager was cashiering. He was talking.inappropriately about a girl who.asked for an application and made it very awkward when ordering. I dont appreciate sexist people so I'll order from Auntie Anns now.
I was very upset, not with the quality of food but with the quality of management. I witnessed a manager say inappropriate things about a young girl and spoke about Wetzels and how they determine who works there. I'm sorry - but if she bought a pretzel and asked for an app, there's no excuse for rude behavior. Also, before you make snide remarks about customers, you should realize that customers pay your measly salary. Auntie Anns from now on.
Walking through the mall, sometimes you want one of those soft pretzels with dipping sauces they are serving up.On this particular occasion, we ordered the sour cream and onion pretzel with the nacho cheese and salsa dipping sauce, a garlic pretzel with nacho cheese and salsa dipping sauce, and a pretzel dog.I can't remember much else because within 15 minutes of finishing, I was in search of the ladies' room.  Stomach cramps, chills, and the sweats...ran to the toilet and out it went.  Bad cheese, perhaps(I do still visit other pretzel locations when I'm at the mall, this so happens to be the only time I visited this Auntie Anne's location.)
The pretzels didn't look so fresh, and the shift leader has an attitude.
Worst service ever. Buy 2 pretzel and large drink and get free pretzel, and display pretzel cups and don't honor that such false advertisement. Not a happy customer. Then they start arguing and getting defensive. If I could not give a star I would. They need to fix this. Use a pretzel picture instead of the pretzel cup
Just like earlier reviews , I received an attitude and bad service. Don't want to honor my card and after I downloaded my apps, don't want to do it.  If there is a lower star than 1, I'd happily give it to them
I don't know if it was an off day or the time of day or what the issue was, but I didn't like these pretzels. I had been wanting to come by here for years and finally made it in. The amount of salt on these things was ridiculous. I like salt on pretzels, but this one had too much. After scraping off most of the salt, I went back to the pretzel. It was rubbery, cold, and difficult to get into manageable bites. Think of those microwave pretzels you get from Sam's or Costco. Now overheat one of those pretzels and put it in the refrigerator for an hour. THAT is what my five pretzels were like. I disposed of most of what I bought as inedible.I am going to try one more time and stop in at opening time to see if that makes a difference.
Here's the truth. There is no inside seating, and the outside seating is limited to two small tables on a noisy, high traffic street. The pretzels were all cold - even the ones we asked them to heat. Service was also "cold" and unhelpful, and the cashier seemed as though we were bothering her by asking questions.I had a chicken salad sandwich on a pretzel bun ... Nothing special. My husband had a cheeseburger roll that was cold, even though he asked that it be heated.  We had to ask for dipping sauce as it was not offered to us.This is a place to maybe pick up some pretzels to take home and heat up ... Definitely not a lunch place as some have suggested.
Extremely poor customer service, "management" with typical fast food worker "i don't care" attitude.
This review is for the pepperoni and cheese pretzel. Without a doubt the worst pretzel I ever did not eat. Awful . I bought this to have as a late night snack. This has to be a mistake as the dough has a sweet sugary taste with an  apple smell and microscopic thins slices of pepperoni and maybe something related to cheese in another life. After a few bites I could no longer convince myself that my taste buds were acting up and had to face the fact the thing was obnoxious and I could not eat it. Place looked fine otherwise I would not have purchased the pretzel and if I has eaten it right away I'm sure I would have swapped it out . But a review is a review and this is mine and my sad experience with the cheese and pepperoni pretzel.
Awful.  Pretzel dog was soggy and gross. Cream cheese frosting for cinnamon sugar sticks was weird.  Other stuff we tried was soggy as well. Probably would love if drunk.
Ewwww. Salted pretzel tastes like pancake on the inside. Yuck. I threw it away.
The display was great. That's why I wanted to try. But the taste is totally awful. The pepperoni pretzel doesn't even taste like pretzel. Oily and tasteless.  It tasted like uncooked dough. Totally a waste of money.
I went to Tempe Paintball a while back with a group and was extremely unimpressed with the lack of safety rules. We've done paintball before at other places and "fingers on the triggers" in other places is a giant no-no when you are outside of the game area. This place has no rules on it or does not enforce it. Kids need to be taught right away to always be safe. The staff didn't seem to care about it, which made my group feel very unsafe. I did like the facility but when this happened we decided to never go back. We love paintball, but we will find another place to go from now on.
Paintball aspect was fine a dandy, the young guy inside the arena was very helpful and welcoming............................................... but the experience before made me not want to spend my money there.I wanted to treat my younger brother out for his birthday, so I dropped him and our cousin off to get started. I left and ran a few errands before I joined them, but when I returned about an hour later, they were still sitting in the main area on the tables. I asked them why they weren't already playing, and my brother said they told him there was no available equipment yet. No equipment available there was only a handful of people there, so I went to the front to see what was going on. Well I waited, and waited, several workers saw me, and then another group came up too, suddenly someone was there and asked them first if they wanted to play.. I of course spoke up and said I had been waiting before them and the kid finally helped me, but didn't show me the same helpfulness.We watched the video then walked to the back to get the equipment, I looked around as the kid was getting everything, and they had a whole wall full of paintball guns and safety gear... I asked if they were all working and available, the kid said yeah. hmm... really. If you haven't guessed it yet, I'm brown.Teach those kids some manners and educate them. Obviously they have some personal problems, otherwise your business needs a "whites only" sign on the front door. Never going back, and never recommending it.
Got this as a gift from Groupon....it was actually alot of fun...we knew we would get our butt kicked by a bunch of 12 year olds....but with that being said....they give you a 10 minute orentation about the rules which all make sense. the people managing the field do nto pay attention and inforce these safety rules. teams are not matched fairly....a bunch of 12 year olds agains a pro team....a guy on the other team stuck the barrell of his fully auto paitball gun under my face mask after he was shot out and shot me in the face. after i was out i proceeded to leave the field with my hands in the air ( as instructed) and the same guy unloaded about 15-20 rounds on me within 5 feet which again is against the rules. i questioned the guy on why he did it and he grabbed me by the shirt and proceeded to instigate a fight.  ALL OF THIS HAPPENED IN FRONT OF A YOUNG BLONDE FEMALE STAFF MEMBER WHO DID NOTHING! the staff didnt do much about this other than appologize and offer me a free visit. they contunued to let the violent gentelman stay and play when he should of been kicked out. there was also a dad and his 3 kids that  questioned the staff about the rules not being followed and they ended up leaving due to carelessness from the staff. needless to say....it would of been a ton of fun if the rules given were monotored. WILL GO TO ANOTHER PAINTBALL FACILITY NEXT TIME.
Absolutely horrible experience. I would give half a star if possible. It is overpriced for the size and style of arena. It is understaffed and unprofessional. I dropped my gun off to get work done and before I left to go to Tempe paintball to pick it up I notified the one employee on staff that I would be coming. When I got there I arrived to a locked door and after calling 17 times, knocking on the door for nearly 15 minutes and standing outside for nearly 20 minutes and leaving 2 voicemails I finally got my gun back. I will never return to Tempe Paintball nor will I ever refer a friend or enemy there... That would just be cruel. If your looking for a good place to go go to Westworld Indoor Paintball. It's a little bit of a drive but WAY more worth your money.
This was the "Worst" Paintball field I have ever been to. There are only two fields, very tiny. The fields were Nasty my shoes kept getting stuck it was like walking in mudd but worse. A few times i almost fell over trying to get my foot from being stuck. They do not clean up the left over paintballs, looks like the paint had been on the field for years. my husband normally slides but it was impossible to slide and move around. I was not impressed at all but because my boss paid for the entry and paint for us and its "Paintball" I still smiled and tried to make the best of it. The only thing i enjoyed about this place was the people, the staff was very nice and took an interest in getting to know you. honestly do not waste your time on this place pay the extra few bucks and go to xtreme paintball on craig or Pahrump paintball complex.
Terrible!  I'm glad that I didn't pay full price and bought the "Zombie Experience" off of Groupon because I would have been even more frustrated if I would have paid full price for 10 minutes worth of running. In my opinion STAY AWAY and just get on the treadmill for 10 minutes while playing arcade game it's much better and MUCH CHEAPER! Keep your money people and do something that's worth the time rather than running for 10 minutes and shooting a crappy gun.
I played all over the West Coast, and by far this is the worst place I have played yet. There are several things which have been a determining factor in coming to this conclusion. 1. The staff was not all on the same page- when I asked about the Chronograph speed, the girl at the counter told me 250, I asked some kid in presumably the manager, and he tells me 285, then I ask one of the "Refs", and he tells me 300; Ok2. Safety doesn't seen to be at the top of anyone's priority list; for rec ball or any style of play, no one should be lifting their masks on field, and people should be walking around with their barrel covers and fingers OFF the trigger- get the picture- Basic Gun Saftey. This place was lacking enforcement.3. Why even have a ref if heshe is not facilitating games The supposed ref was doing nothing more than walking around the whole time I was there. Customers were pretty much calling the shots on field, so what do they really know about "paint checks"- making sure a player is actually hit- Nothing. In summation, I didn't feel safe or taken care of at all coming to this place. GO ELSEWHERE. Note for experienced player- NO 4500 fills either
Was overcharged in April 26, 2014.  I called several times and finally got a call back from Kelly 2 weeks later.  She told me to email Eric and I would get my money back that I was overcharged.  It's been a week.  No call or email from Eric.  Why did I think I would get anything other than no results!I would say that they do not know what customer service is.  If you pay, pay with cash or risk getting over charged and good luck getting your money back.I will let all I know to do something other than go to Cowtown.  What a pain in the neck.
This review is specifically for the DFS cleaners at this Giant Eagle location.  I dropped clothing off for the sake of convenience once (I really should have known better).  Never again.  My items came back completely covered in lint.  I could let this slide, however my pencil skirt was safety pinned to the hanger.  The weight of the skirt caused even larger holes than what were placed there by the pins.  Being that it's a pencil skirt designed to have a blouse tucked in, there's no way that I can wear it again.  This was an expensive skirt, completely ruined.  Very disappointed.  Again, this review is just for the dry cleaners.  The rest of the store is actually better than a lot of other GE's I've been to in Pittsburgh.  Just don't take your dry cleaning here.
Been yelled at by other customers (today for instance)...place is super ghetto...avoid at all cost. Today, left a full cart bacause a woman (with a baby in a stoller) shouted at me for "cutting in line". Will never go back. At night it is a nightmare.
Food poisoning a la Tomato Bisque Soup.Forever skeptical.That's too bad, I don't mind paying extra for better produce or better brands. But, I KIND OF mind getting extremely sick, so sick that anything I ever would vouch for goes down the toilet, with my vomit.
everything is a cluster.  the store.  the parking lot.  the people -- customers included.  full-on cluster. barely any parking for a massive, heavily polluting pick up truck.inside: avocados are the price of gold, and there are no goddamn vegan taco spices at a place that's supposed to be so fancy.  meh.  go to market district where they keep it real.  real classy!!!
the parking lot  this wholefoods is an ABOMINATION!  to compound the issue, whole foods allows their purveyors to park on centre ave (a road that is already miserable enough to drive on) and block traffic. this past monday, a shearer potato chip truck was blocking the right lane. doesn't whole foods have a loading dock i wrote an email to the district president and he had one of his store minions respond: "you can park  walgreens". sorry, i am shopping  wholefoods NOT walgreens. translation: whole foods developers were TOO CHEAP to buy the proper amount of real estate. dont even bother coming here fri-sun unless you like a clusterF*** lot full of zombies. this is the 5th WF i have shopped  (4 in florida) wholefoods should have opened in the south hills. the demographics out there would support it. this wholefoods is BUSH LEAGUE!
I have tried Whole Foods recently even after hearing about the attitude of the butthole, hipster employees and presumptuous, anti-bourgeois customers that will literally push you aside a turn their noses up at you a million times. The rumors were true!!! Even though I was only there one time, first impressions are a bitch! The selection is great! I can't afford any of it, but it's great! I have never seen such expensive rice! Here is the bro-down...The food: Plentiful and too expensive to even think of buying. The freshest fish that isn't in the Strip...but you need to take a second mortgage to buy fish for a family. I bought sushi rice, a piece of fish and a salad, my bill: $25! The salad with lettuce, carrots, chick peas, onions and about 5 pieces of chicken was $11+The employees: Hipsters with thick-rimmed glasses, tattoos and facial piercings that slack like I have never seen "workers" slack before. In fact there was a sign above some fresh fish stating "We will prepare you fish any way you want, just ask" HA...HA! When I asked to have a tiny fish to be filleted (something that would take me about 10 seconds at home) I was scoffed at by the so called fish monger who was obviously not a trained fish monger, but got his job because of his Progressive music of the soviet era bachelors degree . It took him the better part of 20 minutes to fillet a f-ing fish! All I got was a chopped up piece of crap that was useless. And scoffing is what these people are good at. Pushing your cart down the aisles is like running a scoffing gauntlet. Staff huff and puff when you get in their way! The cashiers just stand and talk to each other or run to get organic iced tea to drink WHILE they ring you up...they don't even do that at Giant Eagle!The other customers: This one is a peach! If you're not pulling in a good $60K a year you are dirt to these people. I was at the salad bar (it is a good salad bar, but expensive) an older woman in a mink coat bumped, no, pushed into me then stared at me and turned her nose up at me, can you believe it She actually turned her nose up at me! Others in the aisles will grunt like cantankerous old people if they can't get through. They push ahead in line, give you dirty looks, and act like it's a class struggle...it kind of is!So unless you have a lot (i mean A LOT) of disposable income, have never needed to use coupons, drive a $50K car (parking is terrible there), are the president of the United States, CEO of Microsoft, a widow whose wardrobe is more extensive than the explanation of the formula explaining an event horizon or a hipster who looks poor, but lives off daddy and mommy (though they'll never admit it) you shouldn't and really won't be able to afford this place...but why would you want toI'll stick with Trader Joe's for my alternative market, thank you! I prefer employees with edges that are a little rough to ones with pants so tight, I can see their junk.
I always thought 1-star reviews on Yelp were written by bitter, resentful people who had nothing better to do than just complain. But now I feel their pain. It really doesn't hit you, until it... hits you.You pay a premium at WF, you expect a premium, right Well parking is part of the shopping experience. It's why they have parking lots in the first place. But never mind the atrocious parking lot and not being able to easily maneuver in it.I'm talking about being TOWED. Towed, not for leaving the parking lot, but for legitimately shopping at WF. Yes, this could happen to you too.Upon contacting the towing company, they demanded $135 (cash only) to return my vehicle. Upon contacting WF (since I was a legitimate shopper there and didn't leave the lot) they just shrugged their shoulders and just told me the name of the company that managed the lot.And that's it! $135 is no chump change, but it seems like WF wants me to carry an extra $135 every time I frequent them (thankfully, never, since I don't live in Pittsburgh). This whole parkingtowing situation is extremely shady, but the only company I'm going to point my finger at is Whole Foods for doing business with such a shady complex and passing the burden on to its customers.Tip: Bring an extra $135 to pay for parking, or just go to Trader Joe'sGiant Eagle for a better parkingshopping experience.
I loved it, parking and all, after all, they had Palak Paneer! Mmmmm. It was tasty. I spent a lot, but I was ok with the occasional splurge. the second trip, i again bought my hit foods Palak Paneer and it had obviously gone over. Ever have whoopsies after green Indian cuisineIt's off my list now. Forever.
Awful.  I didn't know how bad it was until I went to a different GE and saw how good it could be.  The lines are long, the produce selection is minimal, and the store is overcrowded.The last straw was yesterday when the cashier blew her nose, stuck kleenex up her nose, then put it back in her pocket and continued to scan groceries.  When I complained to the manager, they denied any of their employees were sick.I'm done shopping at this store.
This Giant Eagle maybe the worst supermarket I've ever been to. There are thugs hanging out by the entrance and in the parking lot. The interior is dark and dank and has an outdated "made in the 70s" feel. With options like this I don't have a problem taking the extra time to drive to Trader Joe's.
Scariestshadiest grocery store experience in my life. Hubby and I pulled in only to see a few cars down, people selling who-knows-what out of their car trunk. Also this is the only Giant Eagle tht gives you a really hard time if you ever forget your advantage card and give your phone no instead (it works at the other ones just fine). Then we leave by waiting for a really dazedswaying woman to finish wandering around back and forth in front of us, and pass by a drive-by fat cash exchange (drugs) on our way out of the parking lot. We are definitely scared to return, and will never need grapes (or any other groceries) so desperately again.
The store reeks of rotting fish, the security guards watch you like a hawk and the food selection is the worse I've seen in any Giant Eagle in the city.One plus if you must shop here there are plenty of jitney drivers waiting for you to come out to offer you a ride.  That can be a big help if you are like me and don't have a car. "Need a car" haha some things about living in the hood just never change. With this being the closet G E to Downtown and PNC Park and Heinz field I would think they would renovate but it's been years and still no change.
Awful.  Worst grocery store I've ever been to.  To make it worse, they are supposed to open at 7.  At 7:10, I was told they were "still getting ready to open" and I should come back "around 7:30"
The store has a weird rotting meat smell sometimes. The selection isn't amazing but there are a few interesting items here. As other people commented there are always people hanging around outside.... But they are friendly at least to me! One thing I like about the store is the proximity to my house. The biggest let down is the sky high prices that I think GE is notorious for... I miss Kroger
Zero stars Really terrible store. High prices, THE WORST PRODUCE EVER (And no, it isn't the lighting...) and rude employees. Never mind the people hanging out out front and in the parking lot, who cares. What I'm truly concerned about is the vast discrepancy between this store and very nearly all of the other Giant Eagle locations in the Pittsburgh area. One would assume that there would be some quality control within their chain of stores. Truly sad that the North Side has so few options at which to shop for reasonably priced, fresh food. Also, enjoy getting followed around by the walleyed "undercover" employee. Looks like Lurch from the Addams Family. Good riddance.
So I got a call from Giant Eagle asking me to give my opinion of this store. My recommendation was to burn this place to the ground. Buckle up for crappy produce, rotten fish, old meat, and security guards that speck you be stealin! This is the Gh**to Eagle!
Sadly really went downhill. They switched to a new vendor, the prices went up and they are no longer having sales.
This store is so gross that I was almost sick! Onions peeled and half-rotten. Squishy garlic. Dirt everywhere. I will NEVER step foot in this place again.
Ugh...don't waste your time or your money!  I would have given it zero stars but the Mei Fun and the Pepsi were actually decent.  The buffet has the typical Chinese fair but the only thing I could come close to suggesting would be the fried shrimp, Mei Fun, and maybe the sweet and sour chicken.  Skip everything else!!!!Don't even think about eating the sushi.  I was feeling adventurous so I grabbed a few of the sushi rolls that I easily recognized (california, cucumber).  One of them tried to crawl off the plate before I got back to my seat!  The rolls were chewy and just plain gross, makes my stomach turn to think about it.Service was polite and good on the refills.Enter at your own risk!
Not very good. Dried out food. Some things cold, when they should be hot. Disappoined overall. Not clean, either. 11.99 per person not worth it.
This place is absolutely filthy. We were here last year and we decided never to go back but we thought we'd give it another try. Went for dinner tonight and was disgusted. There was old dried up rice under the tables against the wall just piled up. Wet napkins were wedged under our booth seats. Under the buffet lights, you can see splatter of food from the last decade. While I was eating, a waitress emptied plates into some bus boy buckets and some fell on the floor and she kicked it under the cart! Tons of garbage and food under these carts. Blech!! Then all the food was cold and hard. Bathroom was a hellhole. No idea why a restaurant owner would keep their place in this way.
Absolutely horrible experience. We were seated and drink order was taken by that person. Few mins later drinks were dropped off by a different person who said waitress would be over to take our order. Then 10 mins later someone came over and asked us if we wanted appetizers which we did and ordered Crab Rangoons and Spare Ribs. This person said someone would be back to take our order. Never happened. The apps came out and the guy said again someone would come take our order. So we ate our apps and still no one. No one even acknowledged us, I had to flag someone down and I said "I think our waitress has forgotten about us..." The man says "what you want" ummm to order Hes like "Yes, what you want just staring at us, no smile or apology. So we ordered and got our food about 10 mins later. Had to wait forever for our check. I think we had a different server every time someone stopped by. The Crab Rangoons were simply not Crab Rangoons. There was no cream cheese flavor whatsoever. I am not sure what they were, but not what I was expecting. The Shrimp Fried Rice tasted ok but the Shrimps were full of poo. Not deveined and completely packed with poo. Just disgusting. Wonton soup flavor was good but the actual wontons must have had a teaspoon of ginger in them. Strong and not really what I was expecting in a wonton...Whole dinner sucked. To top it off there was vomit all over the womens bathroom floor. No idea why this place was full. Many great chinese restaurants around, this is not one.
This place is bad! The service is bad, the food is bad and the prices are high! With our party of 4, we had a similar experience as Christina L. Where different waiterswaitresses would come by and awkwardly take our order, then someone else would bring out that order and then someone else would arrive to help us further.. The crab rangoons were very small and tasted generic, like something I could buy frozen at food lion and the shrimp in our meals ALSO were not deveined... And every dish we ordered was flavorless and bland... The only thing I enjoyed was the wonton soup! And then at the end of our meal, around 9:45pm we stayed at the table to chat.. Being cautious that the restaurant hours printed on the door said they close at 11pm.. A waitress came to us at 10pm and said that they were closing and they needed us to pay now... O_o  So we got up to pay and leave and the cashier man ( looked like the manager ) was so cold.. He never asked how the food was or anything, just "this how much!" And swiped the cards... Such a waste of money and time.. Worst Chinese food ever!
No go. Bought the Groupon despite the other reviews and decided to give this place a try. The location, atmosphere, and service were all good so no complaints there. The food however was not. I ordered the general chicken with brown rice and an egg roll. The chicken was all slimy dark meat and the flavor was nothing like general sauce but rather 100% strong garlic. I wasn't able to even eat hardly any of it because of the brown slimy meat. My husband ordered the garlic beef and he did not like the sauce at all. It had zero garlic taste, was way too thick, and overall wasn't very good. The egg roll was soft and mushy and is a shrimp roll so not your typical chickencabbage type. The place was super busy and I had high hopes, but ultimately the food itself was not good and we will not be back.
Restaurant is closed.
This buffest reminded me of a Las Vegas buffet except all the food gave me heartburn.  I'd been to a hometown buffet before so when my bf suggested it I relied on my memory of the experience and agreed to go.  Unfortunately my memory must have been jilted by the occasion or this Hometown Buffet was just bad, I dont know.  what I do know is that the food is cheap, about 10$ per person.  It is also soft.  And by this i mean everything is overcooked.  And it all gave me heartburn that lasted all day.  So will I be back  Maybe in about 10 years when I've forgotten about this experience.
I went here once with a friend.We had the lunch buffet which was average. Until, I saw two cockroaches crawling around. Not, even your normal cockroaches but, gigantic cockroaches.I couldn't eat anymore but, for some odd reason my other friend did.
went here with my bf and his friend. came in at 7pm. took 10 minutes for someone to even realize we walked in the door..then took about 35 min to even get our food. they didn't seem very friendly. luckily, the food is pretty good [i've eaten indian food in europe before and it almost stood up to that.] i just didn't care for how slow they were.
Placed a take-out order of vegetable pakoras, shahi paneer, garlic naan, and papadum. Did not receive the pakoras at all, the naan was COLD (not even lukewarm), the papadum was burned, and the shahi paneer was crappy. As your lawyer, I advise you to become a patron of any other indian place in the valley but this one.
Based on the reviews went here for Lunch, they had Buffet with one Meat and 3-4 vegetarian dishes for around $10. Tried palak paneer but the paneer(cheese) itself  was missing the dish, it was like having chicken curry without chicken. Long story short the food lacked the taste that you find in good Indian cuisine...
They did not make a great first impression and I don't think I will be back.  I took some friends to try Indian food for the first time. The service was not good at all. We had to go to the kitchen to get service for our drink orders. My friends enjoyed the food although I have had better.  But the naan was good.
The appearance and cleanliness of this place is really nice, however there isn't hardly any variety what so ever for there buffet. There is one table of food and that's it and most of there food was cold and tasted exactly like those canned foods that you buy at the grocery store. Price is outrages for what they offer as I went to golden corral with my spouse, and spent the same amount, exact same and got a ton and I mean a ton of options, and best of all there food tastes great! Sadly I do not and would not recommend this place to anyone. If you are looking for a buffet try golden corral or the mandarin, but don't be lured in by the appearance of this Indian place as you will leave disappointed.
Cockroach on table (and a neighboring table). Lamb super mealy. Wine bottle "opened" in back and then brought to table with cork from another bottle. No apologies. Just arguments. You've been warned.
What are you in the mood for  I truly suggest this place if you're looking for grade D salad and such AND if you want to leave in a clinically depressed state of mind.Pros:  All you can eatCons:  Why in the world would you want more than a biteEvery different lettuce bowl contained gross amounts of browning greens.  While the spinach looked and tasted fresh, the romaine was not, the parmesan was the kind that resembles anthrax or cocaine, the dressing was uber-salty and quite disgusting, the bacon bits contained no trace of pig, and there was no protein other than cubed ham to be found.  While I can see how the entire soupsaladpastafruitpizzaice creamtacos package might be worth $7 and change, this was a horrible buy for a person looking for a salad with some ample protein.  When your name contains the word "salad," don't you think you should offer some good greens
I should have read all the reviews before sitting down to eat.  Well it was 5:30pm on a Sat night so you would assume that everything would be fresh.    Shame on me for assuming things.   The soups were horrible and looked they had being sitting there all week.  The pizza wasn't even pizza but crust with sauce on it.   The iceberg lettuce was a mixture of lettuce with chunks not even cut up yet.  I love Souplantation Sweet Tomatoes and I have high standards for anyone else tryiing to be a Salad Buffet.      I would have given this place a half a star but the manager was nice enough to refund my money so it gets one star.
Best of the Souper Salads in the valley. Gotta get dat taco bar, son! There's plenty of buffet places but they're all so expensive I couldn't eat my moneys worth if I tried. You understand what I'm saying I love soup. There's salad. Stay black NBC. Right, Gina Marooney
Two of the the soups look like they've been sitting there all day your server never even greets you or gets anything for you so why tip
Oh shit!  Literally.  I was at this location on Sunday night (22507) and it was horrible.  The first thing we noticed was that there weren't any dishes.  It was like nothing new was being washed and brought out for customers to use.  Then the place started to smell bad... and then we noticed the waste water bubbling up from the floor drains behind the salad bar.  It was like something out of a horror movie.  We left in a hurry... a drainage grate in the parking lot was flowing with more raw sewage.  It was amazingly gross.  Any good experiences I've ever had in this place are moot... I'm never going back to this location again.
I have noticed the trend in all the location but today was the worst.  Coffee was cold and the cream was warm.  The lettuce had a faint smell of bleach or   There was almost no breads out but a few drier ones.  I took one and it was cold and soggy.  No one cleared my table or even spoke to me though there were people doing that at other tables.  The frozen desert, chocolate, had no taste at all.  It was cold, creamy and without any flavoring.  The lady at the registered dropped 2 large stacks of glasses (all glasses are plastic or paper).  She and others picked them up from the floor and stacked them back up.  I watched as they gave them to the new customers.  What do you think would be on a floor There is always lots of food but they obviously care nothing about food temperatures or bacteria on their dishes. I will not be returning.
CLOSED for good.  Lost their lease, building to be torn down. Closed, closed, Closed, closed, clothes, clothes, clothes, clothes, clothes.!
I shan't be returning.Their festive signage caught me on the way to another venue for lunch, and I thought "why not Chinese"  I'll tell you why; or at least, why not to select this buffet.Being greeted on the way in with a "You are on camera" sign sure is welcoming.  I was quickly greeted, though, and directed to my seat.  My drink order was taken before I even sat down, which was nice.  Too many buffets have you walk in, sit down, select a beverage, stand up, and proceed to self-service, and it was nice to save a couple of steps.But then I got to the food.  Nearly everything had the congealed look of having been out too long; the skin on the surface of the sweet-and-sour sauce was rubbery and at least a half-centimeter thick.  Not exactly appetizing.  I did, however, find some acceptable-looking specimens and returned to my table.The warmest of the foods could only generously be called lukewarm; most of the chicken was marbled with glibbery wads of fat, and all the sauces tasted sugary and generic.  I could literally not tell the "orange chicken" from the "sesame chicken" from the "pepper chicken" by any sense other than sight.The rice was room-temperature, but I barely know this because as I was forking a mouthful of rice together on the plate, the alternately obsequious and intrusive waitstaff tried to take my plate out from under me (though, in retrospect, they may have been trying to save me).The fruit selection, which I also sampled, looked fine, but was in fact soggy and also room-temperature to lukewarm.They have a somewhat vast dessert selection -- particularly for a buffet -- but I'd more than had my fill.Walking toward the register, there was a prominent sign re-advising me that walk-outs are recorded and will be reported to the police and prosecuted.  There were three more similar signs at the registergift shop (!).  Again, very welcoming.I won't be back, unless I'm told they're under new management.
I should have kept driving when we pulled in and there's paramedics with a huge Fire Engine in front of the restaurant with gobs of odd looking people standing around the commotion.  I wanted to look at the food before agreeing to sit down and at first glance it looked pretty decent compared to other chinese buffets I've been to.  But if I can offer one piece of advice, dont go there on Fridays for lunch....apparently every Friday morning they host the local nut house for a meal.  Don't get me wrong, it's a nice gesture but after being in the middle of two pretty intense verbal altercations that quickly turned violent, I knew this was going to be one of those experiences that I would write about on Yelp!  There were at least 50 people from the rehab center inside the restaurant trying to get food from the substandard buffet.  I should have also noticed something was "up" when I saw all the rehab vans parked in the parking lot.  But trying to keep an open mind, we continued to sit down and tried to eat our meal.  There were a lot of people shouting at each other and arguing, lots of mentally ill people glaring at us almost in an antagonistic manner.  Besides all that, the food was not super hot and was pretty gross and NOT cheap!  I would NOT recommend this place for it's food and especially not on Fridays if you don't want to get assaulted by a local mental patient.
Went by this place last week and it is now closed down..Looked like they are preparing to raze the building.
OK. Do not judge me. Do not send me scornful, hurtful messages. And do not preach to me the hazards, both socially and physically, of eating at buffets. Because, frankly, I've done that to myself already. Eating at Mexican buffets was part of the bf's growing up days in San Antonio. One day he asked me to go, and since he's irresistible to me, I said yes. Upon entering Pancho's, I realized it was like a Mexican Chuck E Cheese. More kids than you'd find at Mia Farrow's house. Running in between and around my legs. Screaming, laughing, crying. Totally out of control. And this is all while we're standing in line. Suddenly I find my throat to be dry, irritated and burning. Why is there a white haze wafting from the hallway Oh. Some darling little child had activated the FIRE EXTINGUISHER! Yea. And mommy was too busy ordering her Dos XX to notice. You'd think this would have sent us running. But we persevered. I thought I'd be safe and get a taco, enchilada with beans and rice. All were simply horrific. Malo. Horrible. No bueno. The more I recall this day, the more I feel a need for a buffet support group of some kind. Hello, my name is Thomas. I ate at Pancho's. HELLO THOMAS! Good bye Panchos.
This was probably one of the worst mistakes I've ever undertaken, and I'm including that apartment in the ghetto I signed a lease for because it was "quaint" and multiple men I really shouldn't have given as much of a chance as I did.Boyfriend and I thought we'd relive our childhood involving Pancho's from when we lived in North Phoenix and went to the one by Metrocenter. I had a birthday party at that one, and my party went to see Buffy the Vampire Slayer before eating (I'm talkin' Kristy Swanson here... yeah, totally super sweet). We both recalled fond memories of raising the little Mexican flag to get sopapillas.Walking in, and seeing that margaritas are not served as they should be, it was the ultimate in regret. me: "Let's just go to Arriba. They don't have margs here, and that's really the only reason I wanted Mexican."man: "Oh, come on. Where's your sense of adventure I think I'll have a beer. (seeing look of disappointment on my face) Ohhhhkay, do you want to go to Arribame: (downtrodden) No, I guess we'll stay here.We exit the line, $20 lighter, and find a seat. This place is filthy. The server, who calls me "mija" at least 18 times, I find delightful for the first time she says it. Then I hear her saying it to all of the other females at her tables. Cheating bitch. The extensive salsa line looks awesome, and I perk up a little, like, maybe this won't be so bad.WRONG. WRONG. WRONG.It WAS bad. Everything was bad. The half naked children screaming, the white people everywhere thinking this is the bees knees of Mexican cuisine... it all adds up to probably the worst dining experience I have ever had. We promptly went to Arriba and drank a marg very quickly to forget about the pain.
Been their once and would never return.  First it is not a buffet.  It should be named "Pancho's Mexican Kitchen Line."  This place makes Taco Bell seem gourmet!  Everything is low grade and perpetuates the stereotype that Mexican food is of low quality.  I am Mexican-American and used to changing peoples view of Mexican food because I am a good cook.  But this has to be of the lowest quality I have come across.  All the Filibertos, Ramiros and Armando's are extremely better than this place.
Are you kidding me!!! Do they really call this Mexican food!!!! WOW, cant believe its food. Only thing i liked in there was the sodas and the sopapillas, that's it. Everything else was not a pleasant taste!!!! I would not recommend this place what so ever!!!
I went there with a coupon for BOGO buffets. My stomach wishes I hadn't. Some of it was better than other. The service was great. The cheese Enchiladas were disgusting. The Sopapillas were good, the icecream was funny tasting. With the coupon it was still about $17 for two with two softdrinks and a tip, so I say skip it and go somewhere else. Your stomach will thank you.
Over the years this place has experienced a sharp decline from a place people used to want to take their kids for birthday parties and dinner after church on Sunday. It now is mostly crowed by those who are just looking for cheap food and a lot of it. Poncho's used to run commercials stating they were an all you can eat buffet but during my last trip I noticed that the eat all you want spirit had been crushed and thrown out the back door with the trash. Seriously with as much time as it takes for them to see your little flag on the table and to bring you the food item you requested you will lose intrest or just give up and and hit the taco bell drive through on your way home.The server I had did her best to keep up with the huge level of requests she was being given but seemed tired and mad most of the time. Kind of made me wish I could just go up there and just get what I wanted just so she would not have to. That is the way it used to be and I wish they would go back to that policy but they will not because they know you will eat less that way. The one thing that would make me even want to step foot in the door would be the basket of chips and salsa they give along with the little pillows of goodness also known as sopapillas that are served with honey. To be honest most kids will still like this place as they do serve food that they like such as tacos and also have a sundae bar with soft serve ice cream and tons of toppings. But if you are like me and do not want to have to suffer for cheap food just skip this place on by.
Okay beside the fact that this is not real mexican food it was just sad to even call it food, on my first visit i made it my last the food is disgusting but i managed to eat something. . Then on my way out was the worst part i went to wash my hands and the bathroom was the worst thig i had ever seen there was vomit and shit everywhere seriously a health and safty violation please don't bother bringing ur family or friends here unless u want diarrhea!
Do you remember how Pancho's used to taste Keep that memory and don't go again.
I made the mistake of going here on a whim. Awful, shitty bland Mexican food. A waste of money and my butthole was angry with me.
Mexican food should not be served buffet style, it just doesn't do it service.This place isn't even traditional buffet, you don't serve yourself, per say.That said, this is not Mexican food. Imagine Taco Bell trying to open a sit down Mexican restaurant and then doing a worse job than you would expect. That place would still be better than Pancho's. The only thing I even kind of liked there were the sopapias (or is it sopapillas).If you like canned nacho cheese, frozen tamales and diabetes, eat at Pancho's.
I don't enjoy writing bad reviews, but I love bowling & it'd be nice not to have to travel to Gastonia or Charlotte to bowl. There must be a reason this place is always empty... even with its dirt cheap prices. With that said, I went once a few years ago and vowed never to go back. The floors are so oily, I slipped or fell on my walk up every single time!!! I wasn't able to find the 6 lb. ball within the already limited selection. Food is limited and all fried, that's not a good thing either. I couldn't wait to leave, I remember thinking: this place is trying to kill me.Please just increase your prices and invest in some upgrades.
Im not sure what the hell people are smoking before they come here to give this place anything more than a 0 star... I literally hated this place. I usually go to the one in Tempe, which is very nice.. Okay so this place blows... the staff is running around like animals not tending the guest and its just chaotic... so we start and the lane isnt work, its not starting the balls dont come back when we throw them and the gates are randomly coming down before we throw the ball, or before the ball hits the pins WTF The food is expensive... as expected since the others are.. but seriously we paid for unlimited bowling for 2 hours and stayed for like one hour. Also all the balls... well unless you have little kids thumbs, or giant hands, they wont fit the balls.. which in my opinion is like the  1 thing when bowling... having a ball that fits... oh well. The lanes are oiled to hell and you feel like youll slip every time you go down to bowl.. thats awesome.. pay 15.00 to fit my fingers into smaller holes, break my neck while bowling, have the ball get blocked by a gate, and not get served wow.. i know ill never go back to this one at least.
Why can't the attendant understand a simple direct questionCan someone please tell me just where the Hell I'm supposed to put my freakin' drinkand worst of all ... my balls don't fit in this place.*one extra star for the bartender offering me her personal lighter *minus the extra star for not having any matches
Not recommended if you're not white. For me, it's the third time somebody threw out racial slurs at my group. I am beginning to think the place is for rednecks and the like. D&B bowling lanes are better.
AMF BOWLING at Desert Hills Lanes: Customer service is terrible. No respect to the customers. I did not like Mr. "FRED"(I think he is the manager of AMF Bowling Desert Hills Lanes) angry racist abusive behavior towards his customers!! I dont recommend AMF bowling at desert hills lanes.
It's been a sad experience ...really!Went there with my girlfriend on a Saturday evening and signed up for the 15$ special that includes 'UNLIMITED PIZZA', 2 hrs of bowling and shoes. The bowling experience was regular and the guy at the counter did the needful for which I was generous with the tip.NOW THE FUN PART WAS THE 'UNLIMITED PIZZA' . I believe this was some kind of a joke.1. The unlimited Pizza only includes the Pepperoni and Cheese 1-topping options and none other. my girlfriend wanted the veggie option and guess what.....u need to pay for it seperately...2.  I was okay with the 1-topping... but They wouldn't give you any pizza......hahahahahahahha....U need to request them time and again and again and again and again.Beers are also expensive at 7$ a tall.All in all we walked out of the place even before the allocated 2 hours.all in all it was a HORRIBLE experience.If you wanna bowl try the other locations and incase you have to go this one make sure you don''t go for the unlimited pizza (lol) deal and maybe just stick to bowling.
I have been bowling on a league at this location for 2 years.  They were bought out this last year and it sure went downhill!!!  They are short staffed, never anyone at the food counter.  Plus I saw the person behind the food counter cough directly onto food, which I told the manager.  How disgusting!!  I will NEVER have food there!  The staff just doesn't to care like it used to with the old owners.  Plus now they charge for coffee for league bowlers!  They never used to before.  It's just gone downhill!  If it wasn't for my wonderful team members, I would go to Brunswick!!!
Our experience at this bowling alley was mixed - the pizza and waitress were great, but the management had severe shortcomings.  Just as a background, our group loves experiencing new activities and new locations across the entire spectrum of international travel, fancy dining, stamina sports, down to bare down-to-earth deals. While we don't mind spending a few hundred dollars for a single meal, we do mind it when a vendor does not uphold their promise - it's the principle of the thing - otherwise, what's to stop vendors to perpetually bait and switch We made a reservation for 7 people at this bowling alley to make use of a coupon that promised unlimited bowling and unlimited pizza for $11.95. The fine-print stated that this price might vary by location. So when we made the reservation, we asked them if they would honor the $11.95 price, and they confirmed that they would. We called a second time to verify the price (since some on the group might have agreed to the outing based on the price), and once again, they reassured us that the price would hold. When we arrived for our game night, they reneged and said $15.11. We asked them to look in their appointment book and see who promised us the price on the phone. The person in charge that evening said that the initials in the appointment book were undecipherable, so that he couldn't tell which staff member promised us the price on the phone. We asked him if we could talk to a corporate number to see if they could give him the authority to honor the coupon. He gave us a number and allowed us to waste another 10 minutes only to find that the corporate office was closed (did he not know their hours) Long story short, they had baited us, we were counting on an evening of bowling and pizza, and ended up wasting 25 minutes talking to the person-in-charge and paid them $22 more than we had budgeted for, plus gave them additional revenue via the beers and milk-shakes that we ordered. Among other disappointments, the men's restroom did not have paper towels at the beginning of our evening and the seating for the bowlers was sub-par - far worse than other alleys we've been to.
Horrible service .... everything here keeps breaking down . I was here for 2 hrs and only got through 2 games because of lane issues will definitely be going to Brunswick now on.
Ok i love bowling. And my friends. Wanted to go so i had never been at this place i like it till i went to the bar the first lady was nice. Then i went again and the second. Bartender. Was super. Rude i was talking to someone and asking him why did they close the lil food area and she went off on me she event went to go get the cook so he could tell me. ..... but she was really. Rude cause i wasn't. Event talking to her and ill never go there again the customer. Services. Suck :(
Horrible service. I waited in line a good 15 mins to ask a question with two people at the shoe reg. One which was doing nothing, when I tried to ask, they kindly asked me to wait.... so I did. When the person in front of me was done,  they skipped over me and took the next person... um hello.... I found it very disrespectful. Maybe training staff on customer service is a must... just sayin
This bowling alley is very poorly run. The manager is pleasant but inept. We pre-paid one game of bowling for four of us-two adults and two children. We found out that the bumpers had to be either up or down, so all of us had to bowl with bumpers up. The bowling balls kept getting stuck. When we finished one game, we went up to let the manager know that we wanted to bowl another game. She said we were not quick enough to let her know. We needed to inform her before we finished, so she had already rented our lane to another party of bowlers. If I could give this place no stars, I would. Bowl somewhere else!
If I could give this place less than one star, I would. I have no idea who gave this place high reviews but they must either own the place or be time travelers from back in the day when this place might not have sucked. The decor is tired and grimy, the place reeked of smoke, and the bartenderserver was surly, to put it mildly. We went there on a Saturday night with a mind to try the Irish food. Apparently, we were out of luck. I've always thought that the secrets of restaurant success is to actually stock food for people to eat. He told us before we ordered that they had no "pies". No chicken pot pie, no shepherds pie, etc. So, we gamely tried to order other things. We placed our order. My wife, for example, ordered the Irish stew and he came back 5 min later telling us they were out of that and even more things for several people in our party. At that point my wife picked out a third option, ham and cabbage, only to be told again that "they were out". At that point, realizing that the only food to be had in the place was what was crusted on the menus, we asked to pay for our drinks and left. They actually then gave us flack for not having enough to put it on a debit card. In short, unless you like your dinner with a side of disappointment and depression, I'd probably avoid this place like the plague. Speaking of the plague, I suppose we should thank Mr. Surly for inspiring us to walk out. I only have two bathrooms at my house and would've been hard pressed to accommodate several violently ill people at once.
Take it from me; avoid this place at all cost.  The only time I go is when I am starved and don't have the energy to cook or get edible food.  And then after I have been kicking myself.
All I can say is the worst! We were the only 2 people in the place for lunch, the place was freezing and loaded with kids toys! 2 bicycles, a scooter, and an electronic keyboard graced the dining room. A fish tank with filthy, slimy fingerprints smeared all over it is there for your enjoyment.Our food came... no water to drink, no tea, medium temperature food. Of course its cold, just like the room, I never took my jacket off! The plates are too small, you food spills over onto some semi-clean tables as you sit in your completely worn out booth seat. The fried noodles were out of a box and nasty, the shrimp was mushy, the fried rice was bright yellow.We asked for water, they brought us 1 in a SOLO cup for 2 people. I asked for hot tea, they said 10 minutes. What Chinese restaurant does not have hot tea available upon requestOver all.... my first and last visit to this place. The only good point was that it was cheap, and deservingly so.
We went on a weeknight.  Place was not busy waited over 20 minutes for drinks and to have our order taken.  We ordered an app and it came out with the meals and that was another 20 minutes or so.  Food was luke warm at best.  I would not go back.
Garbage spot. They sold me the wrong case that I needed for a gig that night then I called back n said hey you sold me the wrong one can I return it so I can go get the right one somewhere else since you don't have anymore and they say "nah man store credit only but we can order it" shady ass people
Wish I could give no stars. BEWARE! If you contact JODI and decline her services you just may be harassed. She was rude and had a Very nasty attitude. Please take the time and read the email she sent me after I said, thanks we no longer need your services I also asked her to stop all emails. Her services were defiantly overpriced. Besides unless your over 45 they most likely don't play your genre.On top of the emails she left nasty voice mails. This.This was her reply:From Jodi: Thanks for the VOTE of confidence!  Of course you'll see cheaper rates but you should also be thinking about level of service too.  Just saying.  Trust me I will NOT EMAIL you again.  I just want to say thank for insulting what I do for a living and the priceless memories Sight & Sound Events creates to our clients. I hope you get everything you pay for and more on your wedding day.  My response:MAYBE if you weren't so overbearing you may have had a customer. I will be sure to post your comment as I review yourCompany.Enjoy it when I post it!She continued to harass me and sent another email.From Jodi: How could I have been over bearing when it was you who insulted us.  Really    I had no shot of winning you as a customer because you didn't want my help even when I offered to be flexible.  Brides will see that I tried with you and that when it comes down to finding the right fit for your wedding, there's a lot more than price to consider.How professional, I don't care how many awards you have if you lack customer service which is what is required to run a successful business. And this is coming from the CEO of the company.
BEWARE, If you contact this company to get a quote and then decide not to use their services the CEO will continue to harass you. I asked her to stop emailing me because we no longer needed services and were sent two nasty emails from her. How professional to argue with a client through email, don't waste your time. She has a bad attitude!
I had used Birkett Entertainment upon a recommendation from a good friend.  I held a non-profit gala at the Phoenix Convention Center and was surprised at how rude the office manager Denise was.  I was accused of asking too many questions - worse than a bride.  Questions like, what time is the DJ going to be there, Can the DJ talk to the Convention Center folks as they needed to ensure they had his needs met.  You see, the first DJ quit after I had many details settled, then trying to re-establish the details with the new D, it was met by Denise ultimately telling me never to use them again.  Although the new DJ showed up late and delayed the start, he was courteous and responded to my requests.   To all my friends and connections.  Never use these folks.
Notice how the reviews are for the Kids Quest at the Palms. The one at Boulder Station should be avoided.If you are planning a visit to Las Vegas this review will apply more to you than locals. My 14-month-old son and I accompanied my husband on a business trip this past Labor Day weekend and to prepare I checked out indoor play gyms through Yelp and found Kids Quest. The reviews were positive so I went to the Web site and it all looked legitimate. We stayed at Planet Hollywood and it was quite a drive to get to Boulder Station. When I arrived at Kids Quest I was told I would need to provide my son's immunization paperwork. This detail is not listed anywhere on the company's site. I told the clerk I didn't have my son's papers and she said I would just need to fax it to them within 14 days.I have been to several indoor play gyms including Gymboree and JW Tumbles. I'm not sure if this is specific to Nevada but I've never had to provide immunization papers.Then the clerk proceeded to tell me that my son could not have his snacks but that I would have to pay for snacks and drinks provided by them. I was still going to let my son go inside despite the hassles and a feeling in my gut that this was not a good idea when the clerk told me I could not accompany my son into the play area. That was the final straw. My son was already upset and I wasn't about to let him be taken into that place by strangers.
Avoid this Kidsquest Boulder Station location and go for other locations at Las Vegas if possible!I was extremely dissatisfied about the child care service provided to my 19-month old baby from this center. First, during her 5-hour stay, not food nor drink was provided or attempted to be provided to my baby. My baby was crying like crazy when I picked her up. I need to give her formula immediately. She consumed it non-stop and stopped crying after that. I read the check-out form and no mealsnackfluid was noted. Second, when I checked her in, the staff said a meal will be given to her since she will have a 5-hour stay from evening around dinner time. Obviously, it was just a lie. In addition, I was not reminded at all about the additional charge if I pick the kid up late. I was charged $25 even I was a few minutes late. Finally, the staff over there were totally unfriendly. I was treated like I have been giving them trouble. Their attribute was unacceptable and they were irresponsible for my kid's stay. I called the customer relations department and told them all these. They said they are going to research and talk to the director of this center. I will wait for their callback and may need to escalate this to Nevada Department of Health and Human Services of their inhuman treatment to my baby.
Dirty gross, all the bums hang out here. Avoid!
Lame... Haunted my a$$!!! This place is like any other park with lots of kids playing.
TERRIBLE SERVICE,   They told me they had the bikes for rental, then they did not.   DO NOT GO HERE.   Very rude.   When I called back to complain, they hung up on me.
Way too many people on this trail. Don't Go!!
Hiker beware. I was robbed at 3:00pm in the afternoon at one of the most crowded parks in the city. I won't go on and on about my tragedy, just know the police told me 3-4 cars are broken into here every week. I'm so disappointed the park doesn't tell you there are thieves on the park grounds watching the behaviors of hikers with the intention of breaking into their cars. The cash, credit cards, emptying my bank account in the span of an hour is hideous, but taking irreplaceable personal items is heartbreaking.Don't trust the park to watch your car or fellow hikers.
When you go, you sign up, wait a really long time, get a 4 minute safety video, get geared up.   Then you go in with small groups of 4-5 people.  Just like everyone says, in your 1 hour session you get maybe 3-4 minutes of actual air time.  Its pretty fun but...not much time.  Most (98%) of that time the instructor is holding on to you.  Wife listed this as one of her top 3 events while in Vegas (and we did a lot).  As for me...I had fun but thought it was way not worth it for the little air time you get.A suggestion for the shop:  get a reservation system so we don't waste all our time waiting around.   Hint, don't go here unless you get a $10 off coupon in just about any vegas booklet.
Hostess was very awkward when seating us. Sat us in the corner in a small booth with a broken seat right up against another large party. The place was by no means busy. We sat and waited for someone to acknowledge us. We watched 4 members of the wait staff each attend to the 4 other tables and not one of them ever acknowledged us or came over. After 15 minutes of being ignored by staff, we got up and walked out. It's a shame too... we liked the looks of the menu and the bar list and specials. Don't think we'd ever come back after that. There are plenty of other places.
pricey, pricey pricey and it isnt that good!
one of the worst steak sandwiches i've ever eaten. there were 7 of us and the only people who liked their food were the kids and the one who had the pizza. i would never eat here again
We just ate there on a Friday night and the whole experience was a disaster. Rude, unfriendly, just a miserable male server. Drinks were lousy , service was lousy, food just o.k., nothing to write home about, and at 9:00 on a Friday night they were putting chairs on the tables and vacuuming, hinting it was time for us to leave. The whole experince was horrible... and the bill was outrageous.  Save your money and Go somewhere else!!!!
I am not being hyperbolic when I say that my last experience here was the worst food experience I have ever had. I have eaten at Bado's before and have had pizza that was pretty tasty. So when my roomate wanted to go there, I was pretty excited. There were 4 of us. Two of us had burgers while the other two ordered wedding soup and shared potato skins. My burger was delicious. It was juicy and smothered in bleu cheese. While my food was really good, there were some issues with the other items ordered. Two of my guests cited that the wedding soup had a metalic taste to it while my other friend with the burger found a hair. Being a hairdresser and understanding that it does happen sometimes, she disregarded it and continued to eat her burger. Unfortunately, the hair did not stop there. Another guest found several hairs in their meal as well. We decided that we should let our waitress know. I stopped the waitress and explained how there was hair in two people's food. The waitress got upset and was very rude (it's not like we accused her of planting the hair herself). On top of this, she mistakenly took my burger and walked away with it, leaving the sullied food on the table. When she came back I told her that my burger was not one of the items with food on it and she instantly became defensive. At this point we asked for a manager (who never came) and insisted our meal get comped. Considering she threw out the only good food that we ordered, we didn't feel like that was asking too much. Luckily the waitress did not put up too much of a fight. I will never eat at Bado's again. A good cheese burger and a decent pie isn't enough when the staff can't even accept their own (human) mistakes. I have been places where there have been food issues before and I have also worked in a restaurant. I completely understand that mistakes happen. However, the reaction that we received was unacceptable.
I will never go back. Besides the gnocchi coming from a vacuum sealed bag, they offer a " Pittsburgh Sandwich " they don't know how to make. Served fries on the side and bagged coleslaw. Fries were an afterthought due to the pickle found underneath.  watched a young waiter spill two drinks, or e on a customer.  Same waiter after avoiding a table with cash payment, waiting for them to leave so he could pocket the change, finally got them change, as soon as they left he pulled out his wallet and put the tip inside.So unprofessional. Food from a box and under trained staff. Not if they begged would I go back.
Sorry, but I stopped in this morning to get my lunch because I knew I would be too busy to go out for lunch.  Got a Greek Salad.  First of all, there was no lid on the salad, it was wrapped in plastic wrap... What Anybody could put anything in there without too much trouble.  Second when I went to eat it, I threw most of it away because the lettuce was brown andor wilted.  Not going back again.  I didn't spend all that money for garbage.
I was walking my small granddaughter (not yet two) and when I passed I decided to go in to pick up some shrimp for my son.  I waited quite a bit of time in line for the shrimp, then again to check out.  When I checked out the woman at the register told me that they did not accept cards for purchases under $5 and since I had no money with me I told her I couldn't get the shrimp.  THERE IS NO SIGN ON THE DOOR STATING THIS OR I WOULD NOT HAVE WASTED MY TIME OR MY GRANDCHILD'S IMPATIENCE GETTING THE PRODUCT.  PUT A SIGN ON THE DOOR SO PEOPLE CAN EITHER PASS BY YOUR STORE OR GO TO THE BANK ATM PRIOR TO ENTERING.  I will not be back (the woman was rude).  I have been there before, making much larger purchases, but never have been aware of the restriction.  PUT A SIGN ON YOUR DOOR WHEN THERE ARE STORE CONDITIONS I LOOKED FOR ONE ON ENTERING.  Restrictions are understandable, just not when you fail to publish them and I waste my time.
I *used* to think Donatelli's was a great place--they're incredibly cheap, the premade foods like crab raviolis are delicious, and they have awesome chocolate covered pretzels and biscotti.Then I saw one of the deli members drop meat on the floor, pick it up, and stick it right back in the case! Also, a whole tray of meatballs and sauce from the hot bar was spilled all over the floor. They just scooped it right back in and I only hope it wasn't served! The place smells awful and the workers are grumpy. There's a lady there who's always screaming and cursing and some fat guy that's just as bad. The LAST experience I had with Donatelli's was when I bought a tub of "freshly packed" soynuts. I got home, cracked a brew, and reached into my beer snack to find a WORM!!! If you value your health as I do, do not eat anything from Donatelli's that  was packed there.
Jane is so right. The food and prices may be great, but who wants to eat dirt with it I've seen someone mop the filthy snow tracked floor then put the bucket of water on the deli counter. No thanks. I'll pay a little more for sanitation. There are other Italian grocery stores close by.
Bought expired food, went to return it and the owner said expired food is fine...........hell no
Update:Unfortunately the management has changed hands. It is no longer an authentic Pakistani restaurant but like any other Indian restaurant with colored dishes and tasteless food. The owner is very courteous and did his best to impress is but to no avail.
Worst food ever. Never go there!!!! Went there and had a gyro sandwich got diarrhea right at the same day. I heard similar stories frm my friends and family member  different times of their visit. We ll never come back!!!!!
Called ahead take out order. Stated I would be getting a smoothie when we arrived, but the woman taking my order forgot to tell me the smoothie machine was broken. As I'm consoling an upset toddler she is motioning for me to sign my cc receipt. Really, my hands are full, and my order is not even ready yet. Salad was soaked in dressing. Called back, yes all to go salads are served with dressing on them, so beware, you have to eat it ASAP or have a big soggy mess. (That's what I get for stopping at Jamba Juice on the way home)
Loved the food here before but was so disappointed yesterday when I went in for the dinner buffet and they said they don't have it. It is still on their website. I drove all the way from queen creek for it :-( please update your website.
Awful service, first time I have ever walked out of a restaurant. 10 minutes to get drinks, while one server just walked around very dirty looking and not helping take orders. Food is to average for poor service!
I was looking forward to trying this place out after reading all the positive reviews.  I walked in today at 11am and waited at the counter for nearly 5 minutes for someone to acknowledge me, take my order etc.There were a few people sitting around watching TV (not sure if they worked there)  and a few people in the kitchen who looked out at me.  I said hello  And no one responded, came up to the counter etc.The location is so crappy I honestly expected the service to be super friendly.  I was so wrong.Some d-bag regular came in and barked his order over my shoulder while I was there and the kitchen and they didn't acknowledge him either.I literally waited 5 minutes then shook my head and left, it was possibly the worst customer service i've ever seen in any place, ever.I can't stand restaurants that are run like this.  I don't care how much i'm paying, $5 or $100 for a meal I refuse to put up with it.If the people that were working and ignored me were the owners it's clear that they could care less about customer service.  If it's hired help, they should all be fired and replaced.Take some pride in your restaurant!!!  I won't return here.
went there yesterday, i have never reviewed a restaurant but this one is so bad that i feel that i have to. i went here with my family and it was the worst excuse for middle eastern and pakistani food that i have ever seen. the owner is extremely rude, looks like he doesnt want to be there and isnt responsive to half the things that you say to him. we went around 4pm and there was not a single person in the shop other than the owner, then we sat down at the wobbly, sticky, and dirty tables and werent even offered menus or anything, we had to go up and get them from the counter. this would be fine if there was a large sign that had a list of all the foods they had to offer and what not (like at taco bell or something). i ordered the shrimp basket, it said that i would get 25 but i barely got 20 (i can forgive that) but none of the shrimp had been deveined, when i asked the owner if they forgot he said that they ordered the shrimp breaded and dumped them in the fryer. i couldnt eat them so they all went to waste and even when the owner saw that he did not apologize for it. then i ordered the falafel wrap, that was another thing that had been dumped in the fryer and put into a piece of bread. the whole thing was soggy and i was barely able to eat that. the rest of my family ordered kabob plates and the kabobs were over cooked, and the tiny portion of rice that cam with it was drenched in oil, probably so they would only have to cook rice once every 3 days. overall, dirty restaurant, soggy overcooked food, rude owner. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY HERE. probably good food if you are drunk or something. it might have been a good restaurant in the past, but not anymore.
Since this restaurant first opened, it has been a favorite around our house. The owner put a lot of effort into the food and was always in a funny mood. Today (March 14, 2012), before leaving with an order, I learned that there is a new owner but am unsure if he was the surly man behind the counter. when we open the food at home, the falafel was burn't beyond edibility or recognition and the hummus tasted like chalky paste. Nothing on the plate was edible. It's so hard to count on good, affordable food in Las Vegas and this is the latest fatality in the downtown food scene. R.I.P.
My co-workers and I work downtown and we attempted to order a late lunch from Kabob Korner today, and let me just say I have never experienced such poor customer service in my life! I don't know who answered the phone but we were advised that they were out of hamburgers, hotdogs, philly cheese steaks, chicken fingers, basically everything on the menu. When politely asked what was available on the menu the gentleman advised that he didn't have time to go through the menu and became agitated. After attempting to explain that we were not trying to be complicated just attempting to place an order the gentleman stated "hurry up you are taking to much time and we have other people waiting to order!" Thank you but no thank you we will no longer be ordering lunch from this establishment.
My husband and I went for a late lunch and tried the chicken kabob wrap. We were not impressed. It really did not have a lot of flavor. It was really very wet and drippy. I needed at least 6 napkins, which thankfully are on the table. Maybe we ordered the wrong item. But, how can a place mess up a wrap The place didn't seem very clean. The table was sticky.
I loved this place last time I came here , but this time they have a limited menu n the wait is more than 1 hour,  never gonna come back here again!
The service is awful but besides that the owner has a very smart mouth on him and is very rude. If you show any concern he seems to want to punish you and say your order wi take 1 hour and make u wait. He is very inconsiderate and literally a smart mouth. He charges extra on the bill so make sure you check your biil. Food is nothing to brag about. And with his attitude not worth it all.
Honestly the food is good.  I have to give this review because the person behind the counter is staring at me while I eat and I can feel their hate for me coming off in waves.  I'm not sure why, but I'm positive he is imagining my death. Also the table is really sticky.
under a new management.Food quality and quantity went down. got pricey.No one to clean the sticky tables. so unhygienictaste: No Good.wait time: 1hourguys at the counter are staring and have no respect for the customers.better to find a new place.
Real talk, I just got out of the bathroom. I have an iron stomach and this place gave me issues. The sauce on my gyro was above room temp. The veggies on it were wilted and the tables were sticky. There was also an unusual smell in there. Almost like a sewage smell. Usually I give places a second chance to sway my review but I don't think I'll be going there again.
Food,staff & service all very very poor.interiors very depressing.u are better of cooking Indian food at home it will turn out better than anything served at this place
If u r spice lover then stay away from this restaurant. Food was pretty stale.As far as deserts are concerned, i tried "Rasgulla", not sure why they made it so hard... worst part was after i paid the bill and was coming out, i saw the server ( waiter ) picking up glasses with all the fingers inside it.
Might be the worst Indian food I have ever eaten.
Went in for the first time on Wednesday, with two other friends for the lunch buffet, around 2.15. Not knowingunderstanding that this place closes from 2.30 to 5 pm. The lady told us that they're NOT refilling anymore so we could see if whatever was left over was OK to pay full price for. With the amount of food that there was left that would've been a no-brainer. So I asked her if she meant no more 'lunch buffet price' or NO more period. No apologies or feeling bad for rejecting unknowing customers. Food MIGHT be good, but these people sure don't know how to deal with customers professionally. ESPECIALLY when it comes to rejecting customers.
Never had Indian food before, my husband took me to this restaurant.The waitress came and I saw her hitting something with the menu, I ignored it but then I saw what she was trying to hide it was a cockroach on the wall by my table.I walked out never taste their food if they had cockroaches in their dining area imagen the kitchen
never going back. The food was really blend, went with a colleague for lunch buffet, every Indian place I have ever been to at least had good chicken tikka masala but it was just too bad here, paneer was equally tasteless. The place was surprisingly full, probably due to lots of IT companies near by.
Sooooo..... I can't believe that it has taken me THIS long to update my review here. So long in fact that I cannot remember the last time I went. All I know is that my second dining experience with roaches was enough to seal the deal - not ever coming back here again. Which is a shame because I've yet to find another buffet that compares in terms of flavor. But if flavor has to come with a roach crawling around the silverware (YES.. the SILVERWARE) or on a wall beside me while employees just watch it... I'd just rather not.Now granted my last experience was some time ago (some months after the decor was updated and walls went from yellow to blue) but considering the last report of a roach sighting was three months ago, their health inspections I very easily googled all report problems with roaches or roach powder on the premises, and I saw them two separate times Not likely changing. Eat at your own risk.
What is the hype peopleI went here for lunch after seeing all the awesome  reviews, but I was disappointed. First, the menu is very hard to understand (see the pic that someone posted). I ordered the chicken shwarma sandwich and hummus platter. There isn't much of a drink selection in the tiny fridge. For soda, all they had was the cans and they charged $1.00 for them. Later, while I was eating I noticed a lot of people were buying their drinks from the market, then coming over to order their food (pain in the ass if you ask me). Anyhow, so I was only 1 of a few people there and the food took quite a while. When they finally called my order I went up and asked for the "garlic sauce" that I heard so much about on here and the lady said it would cost $1.00. I said nevermind because I wasn't going to pay that for a small container of condiment! I was surprised at how small the sandwich was. It wasn't  impressive either. Just a grilled flatbread with a few pieces of  chicken, a few tomato slices, lettuce, and a little sauce. In my opinion this wasn't worth 3.99, but more worth 2.50 or something because of its size and how little filling there was.The hummus was good, but  nothing spectacular. This place is also in a dodgy part of town right across from project housing...literally right across the street. The market was pretty cool though and I'll prob return (during the daylight of course) for some olives, olive oil, and pita. BUT will skip out on dining here.
I used to love you, Al-Hana.  I have fond memories of enjoying good food and good company while sitting at your little wobbly tables and chairs.  I fell in love with your babaghannuj.  Yes, you had a lot going for you.I was disappointed, but kept coming back, when you decided to raise the price on Every Single Item I Like, while making all of the portions smaller.  I understood that you have to pay for those new glossy menus with the pretty pictures somehow even though I liked the old menu board with the plastic letters just fine, thanks.  I settled for slow and sometimes surly service from your staff.  Why  Because I loved you. Well, I think our one-sided relationship has come to an end.  That last visit - you know, the one where you gave our food to another customer (uh, you were confused), and left us waiting for over 35 minutes without an apology while fulfilling orders for people who arrived and ordered much much later  That will be my last one.  I especially will cherish the charming way in which the 'manager' grudgingly provided a refund for the food I never received.  "Do you want to return the water as well"  Um, no.  Since I had to get it out of the cooler myself, I actually received that portion of what I ordered.  Thanks.Keep your rising prices and shrinking portions.  You are no longer worth my affection.
This restaurant is located directly across from a McCarran Airport runway. As we entered the restaurant an airplane landed and it felt as if the restaurant was situated in the middle of the airport.  We each ordered the lamb kabob which came with a colorful rice mixture, baby lettuce leaves and taftoon.  The lamb was gamey and way overdone, the rice was bland, the baby lettuce leaves were undressed and the taftoon came right out of a bag.  The final insult was when a gratuity of 20% was added to our bill though we ordered and picked up our meals at the counter.
I've eaten as this restaurant several times during the past year.  The food is usually pretty good, maybe 3 out of 5 stars on average.  Today I used a restaurant.com voucher.  $25 towards $40 worth of food, however, read on for the unethical practices the owner of this restaurant put in place when attempting to use this voucher...  The restaurant.com voucher is a joke.  The restaurant automatically includes 18% gratuity on top of the bill.  This establishment is strictly counter-service, who is the tip for  Also, specials are not allowed as part of the voucher redemption and most of what my party wanted was "considered" a special.  I felt penalized for trying to use the voucher.  I will never recommend this establishment for their unethical practices and because they made me feel like a piece of trash.  The fact that you have to spend $40 on a $25 voucher is one thing, but to not allow specials and factor in an unethical gratuity of 18% at a restaurant with no servers and strictly counter service shows that this owner has ZERO dignity as a small business owner and he should think twice before trying to lure patrons into an establishment that only allows "one" serving of it's special sauce per order!  A joke by any standard and when you refuse to cater to your customers, you deserve NOT to be in business.  Nothing but a HORRIBLE review for this jerk owner!!!
Went there today and very disappointed. Used to be real authentic but now tastes and looks like pre manufactured food. Garden Cafe near by is the new place! Authentic! I
Before i used to believe 'Bad Dim Sum' was an old wives tale ment to scare children from the greasy steamed dishes of utter OMGWTFBBQPWNAGE-ness!!! Thank you Cathay House for industrializing dim sum and making it as chinese as taco bell is to mexican food.Lately in my review I've been doing a breakdown of everything from how the place looks to me to listing what i ordered and what i thought of it. I'd rather not for this review because it would force me to stop, lean over, and vomit uncontrollably. Gripes- They sat us in what i call the 'shit hole' section of the restaurant where small families, less then a few people and generally those who don't look like they're gonna spend a lot of money go to minimize chances of customers wasting their time and maximize profit. Guess where the white people sat- same cart, different pusher to give the illusion they were well stocked- you could taste how much effort they put into their food. i've had chicken mcnuggets that have had more effort put into them-oh look another cart that means they got more selection..DAMN IT those two just traded...DAMN YOU!!!!!ConclusionIf you feel like Dim Sum go somewhere elseIf you feel like eating what chinese people make to sell to foreigners by all means go here and order an Egg Foo Young and General Tso's Chicken and taste that authentic chinese goodness
Came here for dinner and the place is pretty dead. The food was nothing special...I've had tastier authentic Chinese cousine. Would not waste my money here again. There are better Chinese restaurant on the same street that you don't have too look far.
Absolutely HORRIBLE!The worst Dim Sum I have ever had
The wait was almost as bad at the food, I felt so cheated after waiting to be seated just to eat this well below standard dim sum.
I frequent 2 other dim sum restaurants in Las Vegas and decided to give Cathay House a try yesterday because they had zagat stickers on their door. The food was absolutely horrible overall. I was with 4 other people and no one had a good experience. A lot of the dishes were cold and some looked and tasted like they were reheated leftovers from another day. The egg custard tasted like old frying oil was used to make it and completely unedible. When we told the manager how bad the egg custard was, he didn't even apologize. He even acted annoyed that we said anything. I would NEVER go back there again. Orchid Garden and Chang's have much better food and service.
Omg this place is HORRID! I've never even reviewed a place so low before! I'm really disappointed Vegas!So this has got to be the worst Dim Sum restaurant I've been too. With food and service. Usually service is horrible at dim sum, because its dim sum. They feel the need that they don't need to check up on you, because they have the little ladies with carts going around, and around serving you what you choose. Which isn't that bad.But this place... As soon as we got seated, they brought out our water in PLASTIC disposable cups, when everyone else had regular re- used washable cups. How do you run out of cups Very classy for a "nice" restaurant. And we had also got tea, chrysanthemum tea. As I poured it into my tea cup, I looked in and saw that a bug came out of the pot! It was disgusting! We couldn't even get anyones attention to change it out. Or for them to take it away.Also, our Soy Sauce bottle was empty!! They didn't even notice to give us a new one, we had to switch it out with the table next to us.And at last,, the food. It was COLD. Dim sum is suppose to be hot. Steaming hot. But it was so cold, it was breaking apart. Horrible I tell you.
I hate to give bad reviews but this place was definitely NOT GOOD.The food here wasn't very flavorful and I'm not super picky on flavor. The chicken looked and tasted like it maybe wasn't chicken... There was a fish tank full of dead fish on display for the diners to see, gross. There's millions of places to get Chinese food in Chinatown so I would not recommend this one. Also I got sick to my stomach almost instantly after we finished eating. I usually prefer food that doesn't make me sick.
If I could give them a 'No Star' rating, I would.  WORST SERVICE EVER!  I've been to numerous dim sum places around town, but have never been passed up and ignored so much in my life!  NEVER GOING THERE AGAIN.Go to Orchid Garden on Sahara. Do it.
Absolute worst service I've ever had, and I've been to a lot of Chinese restaurants. All the other times I've been here, nothing worth mentioning, but the most recent time will be my last time.Now I don't know who all the titles of the staff, so I'll just refer to them as waiters and busers. I think we had 2 servers and 2-3 busers throughout the course of our meal.2-3 because I think I saw two busers that looks identical, and I'm not being racist because I'm Chinese myself, so I'll just count them both as one person.We first get there and put in our order. I didn't keep track of time, but probably after 20-30 minutes we get our appetizer, still no soup though and that's supposed to come first.  Buser 1 delivers the appetizer but practically drops the dish on the table with a loud thud and immediately walks away. About 10-20 minutes later the other dishes started coming. The worst dish was the sizzling pepper steak. The thing about this dish is when it comes to your table, the steak is supposed to be sizzling in the metal tray. In our case, it came out at room temperature (meat and metal pan), so as you can expect, absolutely no sizzle.Sometime throughout the meal, we asked Buser 1 if we're supposed to get soup. He responds by saying don't ask him, ask the waiter. So we ask one of the waiters and he apologizes and says he'll get us soup. About 10 minutes later, we still haven't received the soup so we don't really bother anymore. The waiter walks by and asks if we have received our soup yet, which we said not yet, and he could tell by the lack of soup bowls. He immediately gets someone (again) to bring out soup. This time, Buser 2, puts the bowl of soup down, not sure where his mind is at, but drops the soup spoon into the bowl and splashes all of us with soup, my mom suffering the most splash damage. He says sorry once, but for an incident like that, I think you should be more apologetic.After a few more dishes arrive, we ask for rice, which is not something that you should need to do yourself at a Chinese restaurant.Finally when we're done eating, we ask Buser 1 for some to-go boxes. He goes and brings back boxes and before he walks away says "Ask someone else to do it". WTF kind of attitude is thatIn the end, they had the audacity to charge us 18% gratuity on a party of 4 with dreadful service. Overall the food was decent, but it was PAINFUL to eat with that degree of service.
[Review for DIMSUM only]I'm sure you've needed to buy a car - a brand-spanking-new one OR a semi-whored-out-used version - at one point in your life and have experienced a nagging-dying-to-complete-a-sale-to-take-out-a-chick-salesperson. It wasn't the greatest of experiences rightWell, meet the DIMSUM version.I really wonder if these ladies work here on a full commission basis OR have been set STRICT ASIAN QUOTAS (those having worked overseas OR know someone who does may have learnt at some point how some retail outlets staff actually have DAILY quotas to meet...OR else ADIOS bish). They sure fly around in their dimsum carts like the establishment is a go-cart-track...and pushing for sales a LOT more aggressively than I would say a carsalesperson would at the end of the month.Best part The moment they knew I spoke Chinese...they went gung-ho-YOU-need-MORE-meat-on-you-SON-"YOUTOOSKINNNNNNNNNNNNNY" on me. (Bish, please...you look anoxeric! Maybe) Well, they still WON...since I tend to be a pushover with asian-aunties-battling-menopause and their dimsum carts...and found my small table for 2 with food for at least 5 gargantuan eaters.Yet, this place, which was recommended by locals (asian ladies that you'd find working at the hotels and casinos that I randomly started conversations with to ask for tips on LOCAL food joints), isn't that great. (I think I got trolled.)Oilier dimsum...below average quality (just seems like the food sat out a little too long as well as tasting rather bland...)...and ISN'T PIPING HOT...mehBut what really killed it for me was this ever present sour taste that wasn't vinegar...and if you know your dimsum (OR even any other food in general)...this ISN'T A GOOD SIGN. Maybe, the health department might have to come over for an (S)INspection...before, as comedian Russel Peters imitates his dad, "Somebody Gonna Get a Hurt Real Bad".If you're craving dimsum, I'd say...just wait until you get out of Vegas and hit a real spot instead. And if you HAVE to be here, please don't order the dimsum BUT order ala carte dishes instead - at least if the food isn't that fresh, the raging fire under the wok will fudgingly kill everything in it.It may just save you a trip to the porcelain throne of shame. (Don't ask).
The food was less then average. I was really looking forward to some bubble tea, but it is no longer offered, yet it is still on the menu. Grrr. The hours are weird- the staff unfriendly. This is not a place I'd try again!
This place was aweful!  The delivery was fast but the food was aweful.  I took 1 bite and it all went in the garbage!
I thought I'd try Wah Kee based on the reviews.  Big mistake.  Maybe delivery is the wroing way to go.  I wanted to go safe with a new choice for Chinese.  Pot Stickers and Pad Thai noodles.  The pot stickers were just a big ball of dough with some filling. Absolutely the worst example of a pot sticker I've ever had.  The Pad Thai noodles were completly dry, completely void of sauce.  I put every packet of soy sauce, hot sauce, and pot sticker sauce they geve me, just to try and gag it down.  No luck.
it was too bad that my experience eating here was a bad one. It left a very bad taste in my mouth that made me reluctant to go back. I had some fried noodle and some drink made from tapioca which I couldn't recall the names and both were not good. My dining companion had a plate of seafood noodle and it smelled so fishy. Not to mention, cuts of the seafood were way too big. Sorry but I couldn't give more than one star for this place. It was just a poor meal experience.
The dishes are made of animal oil which is super unhealthy. And the dishes are cooked without carelessness. My dish is even with some black iron flake from the pan ( usually it comes from unclean pan). These unsanitary dishes make them more disgusting...I think the rate is highly overrated....
Ordered food here and was happy to see that they were open early as a lot of the other places in the area seemed to open much later.  I called and was put on hold for about five minutes so I hung up. I got a call back to place the order but I should have stayed away.I ultimately ordered the spring roll and the spicy chicken fried rice.  I got spring rolls and regular fried rice. This was a big problem because the regular fried rice looks like it was boiled in chicken broth with a few veggies tossed in it.  It would have been salvageable if I got some chili packets but that wasn't the case.  I called and went over my situation with the the person that answered and was told that she couldn't do anything because her driver wasn't there and neither was the manager. I didn't see why this was a problem and suggested that she place a new order and have the driver deliver it when he gets back. That made a lot of sense to me but made no sense to the person that answered for some reason.  This was a bad experience all around.  This was my first time here and it will definitely be my last.
I really, really wanted to like this place. I have been searching for a great Chinese place in Madison and have turned up empty handed. Having been to China and loving the food, I thought I would trust other reviewers that said the food was "authentic" and "delicious". We ordered--kimchee (actually the best thing), vegetable spring rolls (too much doughrice paper and oddly spiced), yau choi in oyster sauce (pretty good, a bit bland, my bf was not a fan), vegetable tong mein (was supposed to come with gyoza, it did not, overpowering flavor of sesame oil, noodles were ok, not great), my boyfriend got a seafood dish that was absolutely terrible--the seafood was nowhere near fresh (there was a long piece of calamari with rubbery material that slapped back into his face when he took a bite, and the flavor was bland).I guess it was against better judgement to order seafood here--or go here in general, as the dining room was completely empty during prime dinner hours on a Friday. Our server was lamentable at best, she did not offer suggestions, and seemed hurried by her other responsibilities (and her boss was yelling to her from the kitchen) the entire time. It was if she had never been trained to serve--when I asked questions she would just shrug, and say "are you ready"I did really want to like this place, but sadly it was not meant to be. We took most of our food to go (as I hate wasting food), but ended up throwing it out for fear of encountering it again.
The one thing that cannot be disputed about Lim's -- a well-established restaurant in the West Valley -- is that the service is very friendly.  Okay:  that was the generous part of this review.  Buckle your seatbelt:  this isn't going to be a smooth ride.Once again, my theorem about YELP has been confirmed:  the more stars a restaurant has, the more you should avoid it.  I'm convinced that every prisoner released from Sheriff Joe's tent city is promised a $20 bill for their first night's meal in freedom, PROVIDED they write a review on YELP.  How else can one explain the 4 and 5 stars for this place  Certainly, it couldn't be for the fluorescent lit diner atmosphere ... and it certainly couldn't be for the food ... could it!The Hot n Sour soup was okay.  My partner thought it too sour.  Hello!  The "sour" isn't in the name to make it sound pretty.  I didn't think it too sour at all and they certainly don't skimp on ingredients:  the soup is loaded.  From there, however, it started going downhill faster than a snowball down the side of a steep ski run.The egg rolls, too, weren't bad ... a bit greasy, but filled almost exclusively with cabbage, which I like.  But the two dishes specifically mentioned in reviews here -- the Devil Beef and the Mu Shu Pork -- were as disappointing as a visit to the U.S. Senate.  Unfortunately, the quality of the food matched the Senate's performance, too.  Even before I could open my mouth, my other half said what I was thinking when they brought the beef out:  "My God!  It looks like someone's already eaten it!"  Mushy, grey, and in spite of the jalapenos in it, bland.  Sort of like Senator John McCain, except it wasn't demanding we go to war in Syria.  And while it is advertised in the menu, Chinese food with ... jalapenos!  Chinese-Mexican fusion!!  The Mu Shu Pork was something I'd never seen before in the many years I've eaten Chinese:  pre-rolled Mu Shu.  Usually, they bring you the wrapping and the filling is on the side and you make it yourself.  Not here:  they do it for you.  That by itself might have been acceptable to all but the Mu Shu Pork fanatic.  But what wasn't acceptable was the salt level in the food.  Unless you have a high tolerance for salty food, prepare to have lots of water nearby and watch your blood pressure go into the 150s over 110!Service was fast, but almost like something out of a bad comedy about Chinese restaurants:  everything was brought at once, regardless of how close you were to finishing the previous course.  The only thing they DIDN'T do was observe you from a distance and wait for you to finish eating.It pains me to give a bad review to a restaurant, which is obviously trying to please its customers.  In this case, however,  I'm afraid the review is fully justified.  I don't know who the people are on here, who think this is quality food.  I can only say to that one person, for example, who said heshe wishes this place was closer so heshe didn't have to drive all the way here:  KEEP DRIVING!  I rarely leave food on my plate and, when I do, I always ask for a doggie bag to take the leftovers home.  In this case, I left food on the plate and almost shouted "no" too enthusiastically when I was asked if I needed a box to take the remainder home.  Oh God in Heaven:  NO!!!!!
Hubby's been here before with some friends. We stopped in here to grab a few baskets of dim sum. It was lunch time and there were a lot of people in the restaurant, but only 3 trolleys roaming around over and over again. One trolley was jook with Chinese donut, the other two were dim sum items. Well, the dim sum wasn't all that great. It was mediocre at best. We had 4 baskets and the total came to slightly over $11 before tip. The tripe was flavorless, the stuffed bean curd sheets were okay. Har gow were below average, leaving the cha siu bao being the only thing passable. One of the servers came over and asked if we wanted to order some food. I asked hubby and he asked for the check. The woman then asked me in Cantonese if the food wasn't to my liking. I thought "ya think" but then didn't really verbalize it. Why be nasty But we'll never come back again on future trips.
this place is expensive and not even good. its really busy, but i prefer not to eat at this place. because of the price... for 3 people it came out to like 48 dollars or something WTH No Way... Thirty something i could have dealt with but 48 I kno that wasnt worth $48!Portions are small. The food isnt BAD... BUT NOT WORTH IT!!!!!
Based on Yelpers' opinions, tried to order some take out. We did not like the food. Period. They couldn't even make simple food. Rating of zero is not available
Did you ever want to try a new restaurant that was rated pretty well and found out that you should whip out the ol' Blackberry and log onto the site just to heave the thing across the room in the hopes of watching the communicative device shatter into a glorious spectacle of plastic and debris Well this was the case in the following review I'm about to "drop" on you! The wife read about Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine that a "Yelper" had reviewed. We were planning a trip to Vegas and figured that we would try something different, as opposed to the usual buffets that we would normally head straight for. Innocently enough, we made a B-Line straight to Chang's once we arrived in Vegas and was anticipating a decent Dim Sum experience. Once we got there, we were left standing in the Foyer for a few minutes. During this time, I noticed that one of the servers arrived late from behind us and hadn't had the chance to clock in before she sat us. I just found that kinda funny and thought I would share this with you! =) As the Brunch progressed, the wife got really tiffed because the best Chinese team, in terms of timing and follow-through, in the Dim Sum industry decided that they would all take the day off and allow the lack-luster, slow, and incompetent crew work a solid day. Whoa is me! Service was slow, our tea order was really late, the food was sub-par, and most of all, my hot chili sauce was late! I loves me some hot chili sauce with my Dim Sum dumplins!I think that the highlight of our experience was when my wife finally threw in the towel and flagged down a Chinese lady and berated her with God knows what! I couldn't tell you what she said but service surely improved from that point on! God I love feisty Chinese women! The Dim Sum itself was not memorable and the chicken feet were like the worst things because it tasted breaded before braising.  It felt and tasted gummy.  The prices were great and its location was easy to find! It wasn't tucked in the corner of some sleezy shopping plaza that may be impossible to get into or out--to! The final note from me is that, all in all, I will not go out of my way to come back here. I think the only way I would is if a friend clocked me over the head with a baseball bat (preferably metal..my head might shatter a wooden one then I'll be left cleaning the bits of splintered wood from the carpet with a headache! Who wants that!) and bribe the paramedics to drop us off here rather than the Hospital. Maybe this way I wouldn't mind the mediocre tasting food, but I'd probably bleed out before I get my chili sauce! =(
Never use this restaurant for your wedding reception or any special banquet . They so nice at the beginning but they so rued and try to make money after you deposit. I had no way to get out because my date already set ,the invitation already sent so i get stuck with them. Service so bad ..I am so embarrassing with my guess..and so sorry to choose this restaurant
FOUR STARS Are you fucking kidding me Come on Vegas, step your dim sum game up... Three words to describe the waitresses:LOUD, RUDE, OBNOXIOUS. Food is mediocre... I'd say below average compared to 626, SD, or even Irvine. So if you've had any of the above, this place will DISAPPOINT ... and definitely annoy the shit out of you. The heat alone made me 289347x irritable than usual so imagine that plus the waitresses' incompetency.
Sam woo was closed so we had no choice but to eat here and we got it to go and took it back to our Hotel room. We found and effin worm in our Kang Kong veggies!!! and then to top it off an hour after I was throwing up all night! Disgusting! Do Not Go here!
Came here with the family last night. Service was mediocre. We asked for some pepper and the girl looked so confused. We ordered five dishes and they all were either too salty or had no taste. The only dish done well was the the garlic veggie dish which is a standard at any Chinese restaurant. All around disapponting.
People are right about this place!Service is aweful, they get upset if you don't order softdrinks!Their dim sum isnt great, and they recycle food, and leftoverdim sum is reserved to another sucker!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!THey also have a credit card minimum which is against themerchant credit card terminal agreement. Very unethical place!
The Place: Older, Didn't seem that CleanThe Service: Rude  Slow... Even though they weren't busy. Food took awhile to come out. The Food: The food was ok. Portions were not that great for Family Style Chinese Food. The menu stated a charge of $1.50 for a glass of water. (Though I wasn't charged for it) Wouldn't Go Again
We came on here on a monday for lunch and I swear there were more employees than there were customers! With that said, the dim sum ladies still took forever to make it to our table! The chop sticks came with leftover food on it and the dim sum portions were just hillarious! The dad and I were looking on the steam cart and the woman said we have shu mai in both a large and smaller size portion............ Really! Never heard of that before. I'd probably say if you're on spring mountain you're better off going somewhere else because this place is a joke and a poor excuse for a Chinese dim sum restaurant.
Food off the menu is pricey and not worth it! Dim Sum is horrible! Reheated in the microwave after a long rancid stay in the carts. This place used to be good 10 years ago, but I am so over it! Blech!
I've had dim sum here a few times, but after the last time I was here, I'm over it. They have your usual dim sum selection- shu mai, potstickers, dumplings, sesame balls, etc. It has always tasted like your typical dim sum, which is what brought me back. Besides, it's close to where we usually stay and it was convenient for lunch before leaving Vegas.So why am I over it The server got upset because our tip was inadequate. Honestly, what server provides you with horrible service and then brings your tip back to you and says, "What is this This is not enough!" Oh, it gets better. She proceeded to calculate the "correct" tip amount for us and said that was how much more we owed her.Need I say more
Ordered fried chicken that was dry and I ate some bone fragments. OMG!  Pancit was bland.  It was not good at all.  Will not be coming back to try anything else. (
Ug! Having spent time in the Philippines I thought it would be awesome to eat here.  That was an unfortunate mistake I shant make again! Not even nostalgia could save this train wreck.The food:Garlic chicken and pancit (noodles) side seemed like they were made yesterday - dry and nasty.  The halo-halo (sweet ice dessert with gelatin and other various mix-ins)  was awful too.  The only thing I got that was any good were the Buchi (sesame balls) but they were way overpriced, and a mango shake that was pretty good.The service:I think the woman that rang me up was a manager and she was so rude right off the bat I should have left but I was hoping to bring back some good memories with tasty grub. DEFINITELY should have believed the previous two posts.AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!
Sorry Chow King but you deserve the worst rating of all. Since it had been many years since I had last eaten out Chow King, I figured I might as well give them a try since the last time was in the Philippines. I ordered the sesame balls with red bean, some taho, and salt and pepper pork which looked awesome in the photo. After a brief wait, I could not wait to dig into my meal expecting some solid fried salt and pepper pork, tasty taho and warm sesame balls. Needless to say I was wrong on all levels. The salt and pepper pork was an utter disappointment. It tasted like it was fried and then reheated to luke warm temp. Kind of like when you have fried chicken that has been sitting in your fridge over night and its just soggy when you take it out the next day sort of way. Strike one. Next up was the taho (please excuse my spelling) which was very watery at best and just was not right. Strike two. And finally, the sesame balls. Something that is usually a standby even at dodgy chinese buffets. They were very small, just bite size and the red bean did not taste right either. Strike three. Maybe I came on an off night or maybe they recently changed up the receipts for making everything  I ordered. Regardless, I highly doubt I am coming back anytime soon if all the rest of the food starts to taste like this.
Oh chow king, you were once the place to go lunch; now I dont want to go anywhere near you.  I remember when this place first opened its doors to las vegas and it once was filled with people and lines that were incredibly long.  I used to love their fried rice and their chicken, if I could recall I remember it being like homemade food. It was always fresh and the chicken was very juicy and full of flavor. Now, it is nowhere near that taste and the food they serve seems like all they do is microwave it.  I went back a few times just to see if maybe I would do would be an off-day.  However, to my disbelief their food just seems horrible.
Place sucks. Everything is premade, sitting under a heat lamp or frozen. Nothing is ever fresh. service sucks. only good thing about this place is they're open til 12am.
Eh I'm just not fond of any of the Filipino fast food places here and Chow King especially. First of all the lady at the counter wasn't listening and kept screwing up our order but it was resolved before we paid so it was all good. Had the Bangus today with garlic fried rice and an over-hard egg. It was just aight. But still probably better than all the other items on their menu. I've had their lumpia before and wasn't fond of it at all. 6 tiny stale and overcooked pieces that just sucked. I also had their pulabok and that also just sucked. The only decent beverage would be the taho. Oh and the halo-halo is alright too. Don't bother getting the boba from here or jollibee. Well actually Jollibee's not as bad but still. You either get undercooked boba or frozen or maybe both. Idfk man I just hate eating here. I would rather spend my $8 at Chinatown where I could get my money's worth of some QUALITY food. The only reason I came her was because my aunt from Texas said they don't have Chow King there and in my mind I'm like "well you aren't a missing out on anything special" but I had to suck it up and pretended like I love coming to seafood city and eating all the mediocre food there. Nothing beats home cooked Filipino food for me. The fast food chains are a joke. I prefer Nanay Gloria's or Cusina ni Lorraine just a few miles down.
Do not waste your time or money going here. It's been years since we ate here usually we decide on Jollibee but we decided to go through with Chow King and regretted our meal completely.I ordered Congee which is rice porridge came out cold like it was chilled in the fridge cold. Previously it came with chicken I guess they changed their menu and it's worse then ever before. The price, portion, quality is completely OFF! Never again!! Don't try their siopao either it was so not worth it. Halo Halo is an easy Filipino desert I mean it's shaved ice even that was made wrong! The ice was in large lumps not blended enough. I don't even know how they manage to stay open that's how bad this place is.
Nothing ever really makes me wish I ate at Jolibee, but eating at Chow King would be the closest. Food is gross. I barely ate the noodles I ordered because it was so salty. I mean it tasted like I was doing a Morton Salt keg stand. And how do you mess up halo halo It came out in one large ice clump. It's a madhouse here at times with really no order. Pure chaos.  I will give them dap for taking my aunt's order when she completely skipped the line at the service station. Granted she's getting up there in years and wasn't paying attention, so I give them props for taking her order, though I probably would've been angry if I was standing in line.I get that it's Filipino fast food, but you get what you pay for. So be warned.
This review only echoes what most have already said. The food is subpar and is nothing like how ChowKing tastes like back in the Philippines. It does taste like it was reheated in a microwave. Its pretty disappointing for people like me whose been craving it for awhile only to be presented with gummy siomai and really dry chowfan. The service is great but the food is mediocre.
If I could pick NO stars I would, unfortunately I don't have that option. this place is ridiculous. Waited over 25minutes for chicken. People working at the cashier didn't even bother telling me it would take long. My whole family ate before I got my food and it was cold. This place is a complete joke of Filipino food. Do yourself a favor and cook at home.
Seriously One of the...worst...meals...ever.I got a seafood and kalbi combination. The shrimp was heavily breaded, dry and flavorless. The mahi was okay. The kalbi was the worst I've ever had to the point of being nearly inedible.Altogether one of my worst restaurant experiences, ever.Blech!I don't understand the good reviews, at all.If you want fabulous Hawaiian food, check out Island Style over on Sahara. Less good, but still orders of magnitude better than Ohana, is Aloha Kitchen over on Decatur.
This place needs to replace its front of the house people. Wish I could say I was able to try the food. We ordered and paid for the food, waited half hour and that was when they realized our order never got placed to the kitchen. The staff has no clue what they are doing... Even when we asked to be refunded our money so we could leave it took another 10 mins to figure out. Without getting us our food they still made us pay for our sodas. Really  You made us sit here waiting all this time without food and you can't even give me my full refund I don't Understand how this place is still in business!
It's just so convenient.  They are so close.  This is my 2nd review.  My son still loves their chicken Katsu. BUTTTT.....  They are ALWAYS getting my other orders wrong.  Today in particular, I ordered for pickup over the phone.  I specifically asked for an order of Shrimp TEMPURA.  When she repeated my order, the girl said shrimp TEMPURA herself.  Gotta make sure since they've messed up on my orders a hundred times.  My hubby gets there to pick up our order, and sure enough, they give him Fried Shrimp.  She offers to give him 10% for the inconvenience.  More like a very bad miscommunication between the lady who took the order and the cooks.  Fried Shrimp vs. Shrimp Tempura is a big difference to me.  They should have offered to make the tempura and gave it for free.  10% off is an insult after numerous mistakes.
Been here before and it was decent a year or two ago, things definitely went downhill.  Called in an order for pick up as it's coldwindyrainy outside and just wanted some good eats at home.  Ordered a Chicken KatsuKal Bi combo and their SaltPepper Pork Chop (they've got an extended Chinese menu added to their "Hawaiian" menu).Finally got home and opened our plates to see HAIR right next to the Chicken Katsu.  I was not about to drive back, wait for another plate to get cooked, then drive back home to eat, (not to mention my other plate getting cold while I go out and do all of this) so I figured just call and they could credit my card back or give me another replacement plate another day.  Their response:1- come back on the same day and they will make me another plateOR2- come back another day for a 10% discountREALLY  If I don't want to drive back the same day for YOUR mistake ALL you're going to do for me and my plate of food with HAIR is to give me a 10% discount on whatever I decide to spend more of my money on for an additional plate  So I lose my money on my first plate for apparent reasons, then I CAN spend another $8-$9 minus 10%  Horrible customer service and bad judgement on managements part.P.S.I tried their "Salt and Pepper Pork Chops" and they should more accurately call it Salt and Pepper Batter Balls with slivers of pork and bones.  There were about 3 pieces that tasted like actual pork chops and the rest of it were balls of deep fried batter with little bitty bones.  I've had this dish at numerous chinese restaurants around Las Vegas like Joyful House who nail it, sadly Ohana missed the mark on this dish.  I'd hate to taste their General Tso's chickenOrange chicken dishes with the same batter balls and bitty pieces of meat...never on my penny.Needless to say they can take that 10% discount (what a joke for having HAIR in their dish) and give it to someone else, I'm never going back.Go to L&L Barbeque, Island Sushi, Rice Trax, or Island Flavor for good Hawaiian Style plate lunches.  If you want chinese go someplace in Chinatown (Asian BBQ & Noodles, Joyful House), Hawaiian Chinese style at Diamond China or Wo Fat. Save your money and stay away from this place, too many good options out there for you with better service and better food.
Wish I would have checked yelp review before I wasted $20. I never thought it was possible to f* up Hawaiian food... oh boy was I wrong!!I called in a order for my bf to pick up, Heather took the order (I should have just canceled and hung up then) I order 2 simple plates I had to repeat my order 5 to 6 times for her to get it right. My first plate was lau lau and second plate was a combo with half bbq chicken and lau lau (simple right) Not for her.My bf came home with our food the order was correct. Now the lau lau.... where do I start with this The lau lau was SUPPER SUPPER DRY and had a nasty freezer tastes to it like it was sitting in the back of the  freezer for month's maybe even a year. Now I know that the lau lau is not fresh and at some point it dose go into the freezer, that's fine. But to be cooking and selling something with freezer burn on it and hella dry is unacceptable. I called spoke to a lady that could only say "it's good its good we cook all the time" over and over again like she was program to only say thos words till finally Heather got back on to the phone a said sorry. I asked to speak to the manager and she would not let me. She had to hang up with me to speak to her manager Austin and call me back. She called back right away to inform me that there was nothing that could be done. I asked again if I would speak with this manager Austin and was denied. Over all. I spent $20 in food and had a bite then my bf throwed it away. No credit was offered of any type.Seems to me that they deal with a lot of complaints all the time and the business knows that there food is horrible and they will take whatever money they can get. Never will I come to this location again! I think the health district needs to give this places a visit.
Food is great just don't like that they charge 50cents more if u use your debit card under $10 purchase. That is not a selling point by doing that only drives people away from coming back.
Was among my favorite places to eat in Vegas. Came in from AZ to get my favorite food, looked forward to a chicken plate the whole drive, got in late, and arrived 10min before closing. The cook wouldn't make any more food for the night even though they're still open with a brightly lit "OPEN" sign in the window. I'll go find someone who wants my business. I'lll NEVER come back here.. you lost a very loyal customer due to a very lazy cook. I guess after expanding they forgot about the ones who matter.. the ones who provided the business and referrals that allowed the expansion. Crappy.
Ordered a meal for pickup, went 15 minutes later and after they rang me up realized they never made it.
Let me start off by saying that the staff has always been friendly and the food is fantastic. I always order the saimin and a spam musubi. We arrived yesterday at around 4:06p (not too busy to warrant a very long wait). We stopped by on our way home for a take-out order. They took our order pretty quickly and we waited at the table for it to be done. It was taking a little bit longer so I waited in the car since I wasn't feeling well. Several minutes later my husband came out to confirm my order because they didn't know what I ordered. A little while after no sign of him so I went inside. Still no order and he was looking annoyed. I asked the girl at the counter how much longer and she said 5 min. Not a big deal but 25 min had already passed so it was upsetting. I asked to cancel it cause I was so upset but my husband was hungry so we changed our mind. The food was ready a couple minutes later and I let him pick it up since I was so upset. She offered us a drink for the inconvenience but I feel that a drink was not enough for the 35 min wait. We only ordered a combo plate, one spam musubi and a chicken saimin. 3 items in our order should not have taken THAT long. The time on our order was 4:06p and we left at 4:40p. I'd like to be contacted by the manager of the restaurant.
Kind of gross. The 2nd worst Chinese restaurant I have been to in my life-- first being Aunty Chang's in Houston, TX. Let's just comment on the fact that the hot & sour soup is 5.10GBP per small bowl-- that is wildly ridiculous when you can sit down at a local pub for a full meal for that price. We ordered Mabo Tofu & Yushan beef (aka garlic beef sometimes), which are very normal Chinese dishes.  The Mabo tofu came out barely covering the bottom of the plate (skimpy quantity), tasting not like normalauthentic Mabo tofu but edible, except for the bijillion poppy seeds in the dish that you would have to pick out ( I am totally not exaggerating). Then the yushan beef came out looking quite bland.  We called the waiter over to make sure that is actually the right dish, and he gave us the snobby "this is what Westerner do.  It's not like Yushan beef in China, it's a garlic sauce here."  Excuse me!  You can't even speak English & you are telling me, an American, what "westerners" expect in a Chinese dish!  What a joke.  Yes, the dish is sometimes, in some places, called garlic beef, but the cooking methods and sauces and tastes never alter.  It is supposed to be a mildly sweet dish with shredded veggies and meat in brown sauce.  In Golden Dragon's case, we had chunks of vegetable and meat in some weird sauce (& no garlic to be found either).  To make things worse, they charge a 10% service charge.  You are stuck with it whether you liked the foodservice or not. What a rip off.
This review is for the restaurant only. Please come here for dinner with a reservation if you would like to be treated like shit by both staff and management. In a town with hundreds of restaurants competing for business you would think they would consider customer service an important part of the customer experience. Especially since they are new here. We arrived this past Sunday evening at 9:32 PM for our 9:15 reservation for two people. Yes, we were late by 17 minutes. Hostess: Can I help youMe: Yes, reservation for David.Hostess: What timeMe: 9:15Hostess: This reservation was cancelled after 15 minutes because you did not arrive on time. Me: OK, can we be seated stillHostess: I don't have anything. Just a moment.At this point my wife says to me "let's go".  I take a walk back into the restaurant and see that about 25% of the tables are empty. This is a Sunday night at 9:30PM.  I come back and the hostess ignores me. I tell my wife that the hostess is a bitch and we should probably just go. We leave. As we enter the MGM casino a man starts yelling my name out loud. He chases us down and says he's the manager and asks why I called his hostess a bitch. Instead of being concerned that we are leaving without ever experiencing their restaurant he takes my private conversation with my wife and accuses me of calling their hostess a bitch. I would never do that and told him so. He continued to ask why I bothered his hostess. Very unprofessional, very harassing, we walked away and told him we were treated poorly and would be sharing our experience on YELP!  My wife's first intuition was to leave. I thought we would give them a chance to seat us but I was wrong. As usual my wife was correct.
The service is probably the worst I have ever seen for such a popular restaurant.   So I take my customers there for a fun night of drinking and great food.  It was a disaster!!!  The waiter was very unprofessional and basically screwed up the drinks and apps and a few dinner selections!  The appetizers came out at the wrong time! The dinner was a joke because 13 of the party got there dinner with no sides.  30 mins later the sides come with another 13 of peoples dinners and one of my clients literally waited for a hour after everyone else had already eaten.  The worst part was that a few members of the dinner left before others even got there dinner because they were sick and tired of waiting.  Who can blame them!  Now let me tell you about the God awful food!  I think i have had better Chinese food at those neon light Chinese food for 99 cents lol.  The Mongolian beef was probably the nastiest food I ever tasted.  It was under cooked and just simply a low grade of food!  When I take out my customers usually I get thank you emails instead I had to write 10 emails saying how embarrassed I was that I took them to such a crappy place!  I will never eat there again and I hope the go out of business!  Very unprofessional, very nasty food, and just no reason to go there!I have called them many times to complain but they make it seem because they gave 200 off my bill which was literally nothing we are even.  Well forget that Until I get an apology I will not stop!
We had diner with eight friends on New Year's eve. Both the food and service were appalling. Apparently it was the first time they organized diner on New Year's eve and much can be improved... After waiting for 1 hour for one course of our eight course menu, suddenly all food came out simultaneously... and in the wrong order. Some of the food (cod) was cold, some food was overcooked (scallops, sirloin). The waitress was giving our wine to another table, after which she said "I was just checking". We don't mind paying a lot of money for food but then we expect a decent return on our investment. Being treated pretentious is not part of that.
WAY OVERPRICED FOR SMALL PORTIONS!!!We were a party of 3 couples celebrating our friend's wedding. We expected high prices but this place was ridiculous; $120 per person for Chinese Food, give me a break. The food was good, don't get me wrong, but portions were exceedingly small in spite of the fact that our waiter claimed that all the entree's could be shared. We did share the entrees and each of us got three bites. The service was mediocre for a place  that charges these prices, very little interaction between the waiter and our party. The food basically put down on the table without very little comment. All and all (and $700 later) a big disappointment.
Amateur hour as far as management and staff.We had someone at the table with a shellfish allergy, which was announced, and both the kitchen and service staff mixed the order, which almost ended very, very badly.  The only thing they offered for their extreme mistake, was a bottle of wine.  That's just not what someone who has just medicated themselves should be offered.  Oh yeah, they didn't comp the dumplings that almost killed the person.  Not even kidding.Anyway, the food was ok.  Some good (duck salad) and some bad (dumplings, hot and sour soup and smoked short rib, which was really quite terrible).Expect to pay more than you should, and if you have any allergies at all, I just wouldn't trust these folks with your well-being.  Hope that helps.
I have heard amazing things about the London location and this one as well, however this was the worst meal I have ever had in Vegas. I would have rather had Panda Express for dinner. The chicken was dry and horrible, the lobster stir fry was over sauced, and the drink I ordered was average. The only edible item I ordered was the fried rice, which is pathetic. $500 + later, I would have much rather stayed at home and microwaved a pf changs frozen dinner. Horrible Chinese food! All about the hype and the atmoshpere!
Horrible... Panda Express  PF Chang type food.  I was sick in the bathroom from five bites. Totally disappointed. Service was worse than turn and burn... $200 later. Sent two dishes back too. Skip the restaurant, but definitely go to the night club.
Im originally from ny and know good asian food. Didnt even go in with too many expectations but several people told me i had to check it out. Not only were they out of my first entre choice,  but they didnt have my second choice either. I settled for third And the meal was horrendous. We had 2 drinks each and even those were mediocre at best. Paid 150$ for a shit meal to come back to the hotel for real food
Dude kicked us out for doing coke. We don't do drugs! Check the freakin restroom more often. We don't do drugs. And I guess we don't pay the bill either. My credit is still there and I cancelled it.  Oops
Ick.  Stay away unless you want to be treated like you are a criminal who cannot afford a pricey item.  I wanted to try on a $400 fur...and the guy said it was very expensive and would hand carry it to the front mirror for me.  He then advised me to take off my vest and waited for me to do so.  He would not let me handle the coat myself because it was "very expensive."  He watched me while I tried it on and then immediately took it off me.  I wanted to tell him that $400 wasn't pricey for a winter coat and that I could easily afford it, but decided to walk out without purchasing it.  I won't be back.
It's a flea market.  Nothing more; nothing less.  It's old crap that no one should need unless you are a hoarder.  There are plenty of free flea markets and yard sales that are free.  This misadventure cost me $20 in admission fees.  What a waste.  It's $10 a head.  Finally, no one takes credit cards... even for the admission charge.  After all, flea markets and yard sales typically deal in cash only.  I now feel slightly dirty.
If you like being treated poorly and as if you are incompetent, then this is the place for you! If I could give negative stars I would!My friend and I went in there to see if they could fix a pocket watch I had, and see if they had a part for her grandfather clock. Right away the owner seemed annoyed we were even in there, like we were bothering him and his employee, (They were just sitting in chairs talking).This was my first time in there so I didn't know they couldn't fix watches, but the owner still examined my pocket watch, and after telling me "You will spend $200-$300 fixing this $25.00 watch" hands it back to me says, "Well, that takes care of that", and sits back in his chair. Now, my friend shows them the part of her clock asking if they can fix the part or give her a new one, they say she has to bring in the actual clock, so they can see what they can do. They ask her what kind it is, but her answer that it is a grandfather clock is wrong because her clock hangs on the wall, and doesn't just sit there on it's own, so it can't possibly be a grandfather clock!. They acted like we were so stupid for not knowing anything about clocks! Sorry, that's why we had come to you, you are supposedly the "experts" on clocks! I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone! Find a different shop to go to!!
Horrible service! The two guys working there are so rude. They acted like I was stupid because I didn't know anything about clocks! They spoke very condescendingly & seemed like they just wanted me to leave so they could go back to their conversation. I don't know about their quality of repair work, because I chose not to go back, obviously, but if it's anything like their customer service then it is awful.
Carrie's should merit a good-humored 3 stars for being a pleasant assortment of kitsch and delight in downtown Champaign, but in reality, it really does deserve 1 star.Why, may you askImagine being a person of color who has just moved to Champaign.  You're new, confused, slightly nervous about everything.  And you stumble upon cool stores like Furniture Lounge or Jane Addams.  Great, you think, I'll find something fun and silly at Carrie's, no doubt.I enjoyed perusing the store until I exited with a friend, turned and looked at what was on display in the "Half Price" shelf.  In the middle of the shelf, plain for all to see  A Mammy Doll, everyone's favourite piece of standard racist darky imagery.  Note the coal black skin, scarlet lips, turban, hoop earrings, prodigious humps and lumps, and of course an apron, for all your serving needs.That's right.  A Mammy Doll.  For Sale.  In Front. Of the Store.Right here: http:static.px.yelp.comphotoKlYiE0VpuP5Qz3ThJ_rWzQlThe look on my face should really sum it up.  Except for the fact that whenever I was in downtown Champaign for the last month while walking to a coffee shop, I would glance nervously over to the half off shelf, and see of course Mammy.  EVERY TIME.Not OK.  Not OK at all.Finally, five weeks after this first began, I flipped.  Perhaps it was all the coffee at Aroma.  Perhaps it was the fact that in an area with an already awkward racial tension I was just over it.  But I grabbed the doll and marched into the store filled with self-righteousness and anger.And I thought, "What the hell am I gonna do now  Stage a sit-in"So like any disaffected post-Sixties, post-Gen X kid would do, I bought it.  I paid $6 for a piece of outdated, racist iconography.  I emancipated Mammy.  (The Emancipation of Mammy--there's a title that won't be a Mariah Carey album any time soon.)She now angrily sits on my coffee table, making people feel uncomfortable.  And I'm happier it's there than on display on the sidewalk for all passers-by to think it's okay to take.Do I feel comfortable that I bought it  No, but I'm glad it's not just chillin' out there any more.And I officially hate Carrie's now.But at least Mammy is free.
The decision of Carrie's owner, to encourage the painting of degrading racial caricatures of African-Americans on her store walls this past week has only reaffirmed my feeling that this place is both unwelcoming and attempts to dialog are in bad faith.  While the protests did surrounding the mural did lead to the owner ordering it repainted, I am still deeply hurt and upset that such imagery was even considered allowable, particularly when combined with the store's willingness to sell racist memorabilia, like the Mammy Doll.I am greatly angered by and disappointed in this place.
Stuff Antiques does have wonderful objects.  It is a good idea to go in knowing what things are worth.  There are no price tags on items and I believe that the owner will take advantage of the unseasoned buyer.  Unfortunately, I did not heed my own advice, and paid way too much for a number of items.  They do very nice restorations, but do not give one even a ballpark figure of what it might cost or when it will be done.
BEWARE!!!!  I was taken advantage of by Joe and this man lacks honesty.  I had to arrive with the police to retrieve a table he was supposed to call me with an estimate to restore and come to an agreement about a price to sell it.  Instead I received a check in the mail for $250 with a note that he sold it!!!  It was still in his store for a price tag of $1,200 and he was untruthful about even that to the police.  How very sad it took the police to make things right with this dishonest fellow!
 Closed  :(
I called to inquire about their menu and was meet with some resistance. the person who answered the phone would only tell me to come in and see the decor and and menu. i thought it was a joke and asked again but to no avail didn't get anywhere. this place put a bad taste in my mouth...ssh.
i am not persian but embarressed to see the wine called royal kirre..shouldnt be there royal kircome on...be nice..filemignone was not very bad but nothing compare to atlantas rumis..
This was the worst Persian food I have ever had. The service was even worse than the food. I will never go there again, I have been in many persian restaurants in LA and the Bay Area, this one stands at the bottom of the list. I recommend anything else but Habib.
Avoid it. Owner is crazy and does not treat customers with respect.
I had heard some things about the owner (Habib) saying that he was a rude person etc etc. During the time I lived in Las Vegas I dined there 2 or 3 times and didn't experience anything too bad BUT during my last visit during a trip to Las Vegas I had an experience with the owner that makes me doubt that I will ever be going back again. I had always heard that the owner was rude and finally saw it with my own eyes.Habib was taking our order. My mother asked if the fish was fresh and Habib said yes. My father asked again in the most polite words and soft spoken, friendly, respectful tone of voice if the fish was fresh or fresh frozen (my dad eats a lot of fish!) Habib SNAPPED back in a rude, confrontational and aggressive tone of voice and said "I already answered you once! I do not need your business!" I was frankly shocked. This was after my father had earlier paid him a compliment on his restaurant when we first got there. Frankly it ruined our mood, our meal and whole evening. My mother at this point preferred to leave but we were already there, settled in, tired from travel and we stayed and ate our food.The persian food here is reasonably good. Nothing spectacular but not disappointing. The prices are high for what is offered though. There are other places in town with better persian food (see reviews for Royal Persis and form your own opinion) but the physical location etc is not quite as nice, although my limited interactions with the owner there have been pretty pleasant. The inside of Habib's is more upscale, say, if you wanted to bring a guest from out of town, but frankly with an owner that can pop off at any moment does it really matter He can ruin any physical attributes the restaurant has with a few words.The other wait staff were pretty friendly. I think they may know that the owner acts the way he does and may try to make up for it (or are just trying to avoid pissing him off themselves).
NO STAR! Went to Habib's with my elder parentsfamily, Habib the owner also server snapped impatiently right when we walked-in to get seated.  He seemed to be having a bad day and took it out on my parents and I.  He took my moms order and when my mom mentioned she does not want her food overly cooked he was impatient and rude.  My dad wanted to get seated over by the window and he was denied.  When he asked for an explanation, Habib said to him I'm diabetic and can not carry the food from the kitchen to the widow seat near the entry where my dad preferred to get seated.  Habib said to my dad I'm the owner also management here and I won't allow you to sit there if you don't like it then leave.  By then Habib had taken five of our orders, when it was my turn to order, I was the only one at the table who's order was not taken by Habib, taken-back by Habib's rude behavior I set down the menu and didn't want to order food, therefore, he asked me to leave on front of my family and raced to my seat as well as personal space as if he's going to hit me.  I got up, words were exchanged and he ran to the front grabbing a phone and threatening to call the police.  We were certainly not treated with any respect.I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT TO ANYONE.  Habib is a rude jerk and don't know what else to say. That was 30 minutes into our arrival to Las Vegas and starting our family vacation.
The owner was absolutely rude. I came with 3 friends, he was acting as if we own him for coming there. Food was ok, not the best persian food i tried but not the worse. Too bad the owner does ruin his business with his attitude because i would of came back if it wasnt for horrible service i received. Too bad he lost 4 customers because none of us will support this business
I took a party of 6 friends and co-workers there last week when attending a tradeshow in Vegas ... I will never do that again!Biggest issue:  The bill came and I noticed just about 30% added to the bill as "tax" ... yes, 30%!  When I asked the server about it, he said that that includes 18% as service fee and 8.1% as tax ... and that that is explained in the menu.  I have several issues with this:1. Shame on me for not reading the menu and the fine print ... my mistake, but if you are reading this review, you don't have to make this mistake.2. Why am I forced to leave an 18% tip  The tip is not at my discretion.  If the server is not helpful, I can't express myself in any way.  3. Why is listed as "tax"  I bet you most people do not even see it and add tip on top of it automatically!!!  That is stealing!4. Now, it gets worse:  I asked the server that if there is an 18% service fee plus an 8.1% tax, that adds up to 26.1%.  So, why is there an almost 30% charge  They add 8.1% to the bill and then they add 18% tip on top of it.  So, the effective percentage for tip is higher than 18%.Food:  It was no special in any way.  I am very familiar with Persian food.  I have had it in many cities and many countries.  I look for Persian restaurants everywhere I go.  This restaurant is not bad but it is not good either.  The food in NO WAY justifies the prices they charge!  I had chicken with bones, and it was not cooked well.  For appetizer, we had tadig which the crispy rice that is cooked in the bottom of the pan, and we had it with two kinds of stew.  Tadig was good but not enough for 6 people.  Stews were OK, but again not special.Service:  It was OK.  The server was not really pleasant: smiling or welcoming.  He was not rude or anything, but I felt like we were bothering him being there.  And the place was not busy.  The service in NO WAY justified more than 18% in tip.  But think about it the guy didn't care because he knew he will get his tip any way.  I will not recommend this place:  not for food, not for service and not for being overcharged!
Habibbbbbb is the rudest, meanest, uglyist, guy I have ever seen as a owner of restaurant. He treats his persian customer so badly, like he is living in Iran or Afghanestan.  He thinks persian people here don't have any right in his restaurant.  last time we were a party of 10 . waiting 2 hours , not that it was crowded , but because he just had one waiter.  the worker are terrified of him.  The food has very low quality, small portion , uncooked, but the price was so high. He charged 35% gratitude which comes with the bill and we had no choice , but to pay.  Bad experience , never go back and don't suggested to anyone. don't let the environment follish you.
First if there is a way to give zero stars, I would give it. I took my friends with his kids and my family there for lunch while visiting the city for a trade show. Shame on me for not reading the reviews!Waiter: The waiter, like others reported on their reviews, was the owner. He was rude, impatient and not interested in providing a traditional service. My son is only tow years old, and ordering a whole meal would have been a waste. So, I politely asked if I could have an extra plate. Waiter was fast to add that he charges $5 for sharing a plate. The first time I heard of such foolish charge.  Our table was in an area where the waiter couldn't reach three of my guests, and we told him that we can pass things down to him. He got upset and made a snappy remark. Food:  The food was about average.  Most of us ordered the same dish, and we all had meat that were not cooked all the way. We mentioned it to him at the end of our meal just to bring it to his attention. All and all the experience was horrible, and I do t recommend this to anyone.
I do not recommend. This place is expensive for what it is. They were unaware they even have this Yelp promotion. They hesitantly gave me 10% off one of my entrees but not my entire order. A group of 3 people(that looked like they knew the worker) arrived and placed their order after me, but got their order before me. Just bad customer service.
Yelp. No. I've noticed that yelp reviews in vegas from off the strip can't be trusted. I cannot believe this place has 4 stars. I came in for lunch and ordered from the lunch menu. I was either jipped or the picture on the menu lies to you. I only received one small kabob for my order that cost me $9. Rip off much My favorite part of the meal was probably the rice..... Sad, I know. Not to mention it took me 20 minutes to get my food when I was the only customer there. Isn't this kind-of a fast food joint anyways
I was really excited to find out that there was a vegetarian option across the street from my college.  However, I have had several bad experiences with the restaurant. I have attempted to eat here twice when they were closed. One time when I did catch them while they were open, they were out of the main ingredient in the dish I wanted to order, asparagus. So, on the fourth try, I was successful at ordering what I wanted and they were actually open. Unfortunately, the price soured my mouth. I think that at $20 dollar each for a veggie stir fry and purple shoots is absolutely insane. Picture it, two scoops of rice with various vegetables. $20 each It wasn't even as if it was a LARGE serving. I'd skip Persian Garden and go to Mu Shu grill on the other corner; it's much less pricey.
The worst Persian food I ever ate.Hummus was tasteless. Gyro meat was that pre-sliced frozen meat you can buy at CostCo. I won't be back.I have nothing more to say than stay away........................................................................
This may be the best restaurant in all of the Phoenix metro area. It might surpass all of the hottest places to eat around here on the weekend. But it's not Persian. No more than say...mcdonalds. They had grilled cheese. Yep. First thing that warned us when we got there was the sign talking about this was one of their lunch specials. They had falafel. Falafel is middle eastern Arabic thought to have originated from Egypt. Persians are not Arabs. So not Persian food.They had gyros. Gyros are Greek. Even farther off (but closer than grilled cheese). They DID have chicken kababs but you could tell they weren't any more Persian than some chicken I throw on the grille. I hated to give this place a low review because we didn't eat there. But we did drive all across town to eat there only to find out they have zero persian Food. No koobideh. No barg kabab.
Because no stars was not an option. Traveled from north phoenix because of the reviews....735 on friday night and they're locked up. No lights on. According to the information here, they should be open. Peace out!
Why bother
Our dining experience was less than desirable & very disappointing. Save your money folks. There are much better dining options in Scottsdale!  The decor is nice & is far superior than the service & food. When our waiter showed up he greeted us with "are you ready".  There was no explanation of how to eat the onion, basil, cilantro & strips of breadbutter. The food was very bland. I had the veggie eggplantokra dish which was very over cooked. The eggplant was gross and hard to even get on my fork. Very mushy and reminded me of snot!!!  The okra was mushy and flavorless. I ended up adding raw onion from the appetizer plate just to get some flavor. The rice was okay. My hubby had the veggie skewer and agreed it was very bland & tasteless. Not worth the price. We will never return!Plus the staff needs a refresher course in customer service!
A group of 7 woman chose to dine at the Persian room.  We came from all over the valley, from Goodyear, from Chandler, etc.  How excited we were.  We all had heard such wonderful comments about the restaurant.  We went on an Saturday night, reservations at 6. Assumingly, their busiest night, so they should have been well prepared.  What a horrendous experience we had.  It started off well.  But we noticed right away the service was slow.  When I was finally able to flag someone down to take my drink order, I was informed they could not make a mojito as they did not have any mine.  No mint  A middle eastern restaurant without mint They tried to push their signature drink on me, but I was not interested.  I had already been informed the drink was overly sweet.  Fine, I just stuck with water.  Another attendee ordered a Pear Martini that she had to send back as it tasted like cough syrup.  She ended up with one of their signature drinks.  Dinners were ordered.  For $17.00 I received a large plate with 34 of it rice and what looked like one skewer of chicken.  Looking around, the plates of the other attendees looks pretty much the same, a small portion of meat and 34 of rice.  The entire time we were there [approx. 3 hours] not once were our water glasses refilled.   Not once did the waitress come over and asked how everything was, did we need anything.  Not once.  After dinner, the dinner plates took an extremely long time to be removed and not all the plates were removed.  Two of the woman ordered the Persian Pastry, only to be informed by the waitress they were all out of it.  Did the woman want something else  One woman ordered baklava and the other ordered another item off the menu.  What she received was not what she ordered on the menu, but instead another item was brought out, having been told once again, the second dessert she ordered was not available either.  Two of us women decided to order an after dinner coffee, with a shot of Kahlua and whipped cream. They were brought out iced, and in a whiskey glass.  What  I informed the waiter I wanted hot coffee.  Got my hot coffee, luke warm, and again in a whiskey glass.  Really  I wanted a cup of coffee, and I get it in a whiskey glass  Another woman at the table just wanted a cup of regular coffee and it took the waitress over 15 minutes to bring her the coffee.  What, did they have to pick and grind the beans.  Meanwhile, dirty dinner plates remained on the table.  Finally, we all had enough.  Once of the woman took charge after the waitress was bringing by the checks.  She wanted to speak with the manager.  During the 12 hour, many discussions took place, whereas the manager was very condescending. [Makes you wonder if that is how he speaks with his customers in general, or just us because we were woman]. They were understaffed that night.  It's a Saturday night.  It is the restaurant's responsibility to make sure they are staff and the customers are attended to.  He offered to give a $30 dollar gift card for us to come back.  Come back  That was laughable.  We are never coming back and cannot wait to tell our experience to our friends.  The manager then comes over with the two desserts that were initially ordered  Where were these the first time around  Oh, the waitress did not know that they did in fact have the desserts.  Would we like them know No!  What we want is our check and some compensation for our horrible experience.  "We could box up the desserts and you can take them home".  What part of no did he not understand.  After much insistence he did comp some of each of our checks, but the full gratuity was left on.  No way.  We were not leaving a full tip.  The woman was a horrendous waitress and full tips were not given.  Never ever ever going back!!  The show Mystery Diners would have had a field day with this one.
Very overrated. Our food was cold and my vegetarian dish was awful. Overall a bad experience.
Ordered 35 on the menu. Extremely disappointed. Four pieces of hard lamb... and 95% of the dish Jasmine rice. Very blah. Will never come back.
My husband and I were the only Caucasian Hispanic couple in the joint so I guess we got the visitors (non-ethic related) plate--one that was bland, skimpy, cold and had a hair in it.  I can't help but to notice that the BAD food is for the Gringos. Sunday was busy, we dressed casually and got the the bad joke about my hubby's t-shirt from the waiter. There were plenty of casual exercise wearing families there.I would have been very upset had I felt like I dressed for a special occasion and received this Extremely Bad Food. Big deal on the decor, the inside looks like an over the top gaudy and old fashioned ethnic restaurant. My husband and I would have rather eaten at a fast food (forbidden for us) restaurant! Lamb was a cheaply cut, marinated in water and pounded to separate the grizzle. A measly 4 1 inch pieces that aren't even 1 inch solid chucks of meat. Seriously, I can cook Persian food MUCH better.  The plate made the portions look large.  The service was fast but the portions misleading and a TOTAL ripp off.The waiter never checked on us. And how do you eat chunks of raw onion with basil and bread Who wants to be around someone after eating raw onions--GROSS! I would give this zero stars but the yogurt dip was the only good thing.PS: Groupon sucks for carrying this crap
Not sure if this has changed hands, but the gyro I got had minimal meet at best. Big dissatisfaction. Won't be back
i have been visiting this restaurant since i moved to AZ. it was very delicious at first, but the quality started to drop down a lot with time. lately, they were always been serving me an almost frozen food especially lamb shank. lightly warmed up, and very cold from inside. i was very disappointed and frustrated. also, what really bugged me was that i talked to the manager about this issue and i proved that to him, but he did not show any type of courtesy such as 10-15% off for their low quality food. NOT EVEN A SMALL DISH of desserts.
This place has went down the drain. From one of our favorite weekly visits to probably some of the worst customer service. Very disappointed to what this place has become
The kabob and food is ok, but they add food fillers and additives which makes you bloated and nauseated. Furthermore, they are a rip off restaurant. A group of us decided to eat here and they quoted us a fixed price for the buffett, soft drinks and deserts.  However, when they brought the bill they added extra price for soft drinks and we did not get any deserts as promised.  I would never go back to this establishment and would take my bussiness elsewhere with higher quality foods and honest service.
Went to TK specifically to try the pistachio ice cream. They were out. Then I asked what other dessert I could try instead (read: I want to spend money in your establishment), I was told I could only get dessert if I ordered other food as well. And they promptly lost a potential customer for this inane rule.
If your business says you are open until 9:30pm, then you should be taking customers.  If not, lock your doors.  We arrived at 9:15pm and asked if food was being served as we could sense a hesitation in the greeting.  She went to "check".  Afterwards, another woman came out (the head honcho) and told us, "We can serve you, but you'd have to be out by 10:30 (with a straight face and looked us in the eye).  My friend looked at me to see what I was thinking.  I was already on my way out the door.  That was highly disrespectful.  There is a way to talk to people.  Just say your kitchen is closed.  I don't tolerate ANY level of disrespect from ANY establishment.  So maybe your business is doing THAT well that you feel you don't need new customers.  (I don't think any business is is in that position, especially nowadays).  I don't care what you're serving up in there, no thanks.  There are way too many places to eat...pause.
I just got a take out from here, the Beef Kabob. There is a reason I get take out,  I can't cook. But I darn sure could have cooked this one. I got white rice (Uncle Bens), some meat that had been cooked on the grill straight from the cow, no spices  sauces or anything extravagant lke that, and a half onion that might have passed over the grill on the way to my takeout box.A hint of yellow coloring that may have been either saffron or crayon, I'm not sure. It sure looked pretty but didn't taste like anything.$18 bucks after take out tip, I wish I'd just gone to Wendy's.
We went there with high hopes & but got disappointment.Many of the items had just rice with charred vegetables without any spice. Even meat items had no taste. We felt it too costly for the quality we got.Desserts were okay.
Persian food is known for subtle, well crafted delicious  food. Tasty kabab fails off the bat. This place used to be one of the best in Phoenix when it opened. It has changed hands many times and getting worst. Besides the sub par food, the tired decor and bad service make a visit to this place a mistake. When I asked the owner for my tea, she even snarled and said when she gets done with her paperwork. By the way, the tea was never delivered. There are many better Persian restaurant choices
Worst service ever, the manager was angry and screaming and was being very rude when we asked her about the meals, never going there again, she was screaming at all the waitresses.
Bad service. Cold food. Not even a smile from the servant or the owner lady. We asked her to warm the food for us and she started complaining about our request saying "don't you see how hot it is" OH HELLO it doesn't matter, coz we didn't like the way it feels when you provided it. Finally we had to wait for 15 minutes for the check even though we asked for it. The the ugly servant came with the check and just dropped it on the table without even being polite to some extends. Totally not recommended restaurant. You could find a better place for the price you gonna pay here with bad service.Waste of mood. Waste of time. Waste of money.
Really 4 stars!! This place was AWFUL. I love AfghaniPersianMediterraneanetc, but the food here is completely uninspired, cafeteria-grade slop, from start to finish. Usually Yelp has some fairly reliable reviews, but the 8 or so for this place were just completely off base. Hummus was fine, the only edible thing ordered. Fried eggplant appetizer was lacking is both flavor and ingenuity -- all I could taste was oil. Lamb kabobs -- the best stateside, according to one delusional reviewer -- just an utter joke. 5 tiny pieces of dry, overcooked and tasteless lamb, one of which was all cartilage. The accompanying salad was an Albertson's-grade ruffage melange. The other lamb rice dish was better, at least not super tough or bland, and the rice was alright, but the lentils were not cooked--like at all. I know restaurants have off nights, but any restaurant worth its salt should come through with at least one or two solid dishes. I wouldn't come within shitting distance of this place ever again. To y'all believers out there, all I can say is:WTF! WTF! WTF! WTF! WTF! WTF! WTF! WTF! WTF! WTF! WTF! WTF! WTF! WTF! WTF! WTF! WTF! WTF! WTF! WTF! WTF! WTF! WTF! WTF! WTF! WTF! WTF! WTF! WTF! WTF! WTF! WTF! WTF! WTF! WTF! WTF! WTF! WTF! WTF! WTF! WTF! WTF! WTF! WTF! WTF! WTF! WTF! WTF! WTF! WTF!
Fart Face Apparently I can't eat a shitty meal without being the subject of pointless ridicule. Maybe if I was as high off of my own ego as one reviewer (let's call her "Dog Shit"), I would've enjoyed the charcoal briquettes trying to pass as lamb kabobs DS recommended. Or the oil pouches masquerading as the 'traditional' fried eggplant app I've had at many Med eateries....maybe 'ingenuity' was the wrong word -- 'flavor' was sufficient -- but wtf Is that what this spat is about Word choice 'Rebellious iconoclast' is redundant, but I don't get my rocks off on scrutinizing sloppy diction on a fucking food reviewing website. DS is defensive bc I had a bad meal at a restaurant she likes. BFD! This is about the food, not you, DS. It's always about the food! I could give two shits about what you or your cadre of ass-kissing lemmings who drool over every SAT word and spunky made-up phrase populating your reviews think about Kabob Palace. I just want tasty food. Maybe it was an off night -- who knows. But unless you're paying, I'm not going back.So let's just boil this shit down to its essence: The food I ate SUCKED. Get over it.
I decided to check this place out to see what all the fuss was about.  Four reasons to not bother:1. Despite being in a strip mall at the intersection of two major roads and close by several upscale neighborhoods, the "Palace" was completely empty at 12:30 on a weekday.  Never a good sign.  Guess this place doesn't do a lot of lunch business. 2. I had the lamb kabobs which were dry and gamey like overcooked deer meat.  Meh.3. The decor leaves much to be desired, the food leaves much to be desired, and the service was slow and grumpy.  Did I wake them from their midafternoon siesta  4. Even Olive Garden has more variety, more consistency, a more pleasant atmosphere and better value.  With so many better options in Vegas, why would you come here  Oh that's right.  No one does.
hit the Palace last week with the roomie - it's 7 pm - we're the only customers.  ok, it's the holidays, the economy sucks, blah blah blah.Amazingly, after being seated, it takes 3 minutes for someone to take our drink order.  After ordering a water and soda, the server rolls her eyes - i sense it was because we didn't order more.  Order the kabob combo,  geez i don't even remember what else, the delay in taking the order, the delay in getting the food, i really can't remember what the food was like - fuck this place !
Are you freakin' kidding me I can't see how this place could possibly get more than one star. In fact, if I could give it ZERO stars, that's what I'd do.Terrible service. And someone was having a big screaming match in the back, so they turned the music up to try to drown them out.Tough, disgusting, dry, overcooked excuse of lamb kabob with sides that weren't any better. Decor = -1. Service = -1. Screaming match = -5. Food = -1If you want good kabobs there are way better places to go.Yuck.Place seems to be under new ownership and the location looked different. I wonder if my past review was confused about locale or if this one is.
Dropped by after church. We were told that the Sunday Buffet starts at 1PM. We were just 15 minutes early so we decided to wait it out and ordered Persian tea. The food for the buffet started trickling out after 1 PM and the last dish came out at exactly 2:11 PM, approx 1.5 hrs when we arrived.The food was tasteless and the gentleman at the counter kept telling us everything will be out in 1 minute! I tried the meatballs but there seems to be egg shells in them! I could hear and taste the crunch!We still tried what they brought out, but for the money we paid ($8,95 per), I would have rather gone to Zaytoon's on Durango at Twain.This place is a sorry excuse for a restaurant.
The people who work here are very rude. I have gone back a few times thinking it may have just been the person working that day was just a rude person, but no it happen every time. I am not a young hip person and felt very out of place there. It is like you are walking into someone's house and bothering them. The people working behind the counter act like you are interfering with there conversation. Plus it is very dirty. Perhaps the people working there should try cleaning the place instead of talking to each other. I will not go back again.
The coffee isn't good and they don't seem to care. If you're a local, I get that it's the only game in town but this place isn't worth traveling for. I really wanted to like tazza d'oro. I've been several times, hoping that my bad experiences were isolated incidences. I drink espresso. I know what it should taste like and what it looks like when the person making it gives a damn. I have no complaints about paying $3.00 for an espresso but if it isn't right and I let you know you should probably try again. The last time I went in, both baristas admitted they hadn't triedpulled the espresso I ordered. The gentlemen working there, who was very nice, pulled my shot. I tried it and it was very sour. I let the girl standing directly in front of me know that I didn't think it was pulling correctly and her response was an unenthused look and the comment "ya well we just got it". Silly me to have expected that you also want the espresso you "just got" to taste good...This place clearly isn't going anywhere in the near future. It's a favorite with locals who like to hangout there. It's just a shame that they seem to have all of the equipment and even the beans to make at least a decent shot and they don't seem to care about actually pulling it off.
I want to give this dump a big fat 0.My mother and I went this past weekend very hopeful that the food would be good based on the fact they won Best in Madison. How on earth did this place win any award for great food and service is beyond me.The menu was extremely old, small and the coffee was pure water.  I order the walleye, hash browns, toast and eggs breakfast.My mother order biscuits and gravyMy toast was cold, hash browns had no tastes, over easy eggs were not cooked fully and fish was very small in size.Mothers gravy was too salty and a thick bunch of sop. The menu had no coordination. Biscuit,gravy and hash browns That is nothing but starch!With that aside,Not only that but the server was horrible. I felt like she ignored my mother and I the entire time. I understand they were kinda busy. Fine. We can be patient. However, she refilled coffees at her other tables and stopped by to tell the customers their food was being made after waiting for so long. We did not receive such treatment. She passed our table several times and never once asked us how was the food or why our orders were taking so long. Not once.  She was a horrible waitress.Neither my mother or I could finish our food. I took possibly 4 bites and was done.We spent less time eating then we did waiting and ordering. Waitress continued to ignore us, so we got up and just walked over to pay.I told the cashier the food was horrible and I wouldn't be back. She then stated to us that normally the food is good and she wasn't sure why it was taking the kitchen so long and were getting orders wrong. But here is the killer... she then leans over and says " I hate our kitchen staff, we need new ones"What kind of place does that You do no throw your co workers under the bus TO CUSTOMERS! I was beyond flabbergasted. Just a horrible business, not friendly and food is beyond pathetic. Do not go here. I have no idea who in their right mind would vote them as "Best in Madison" or give it 5 stars unless you do not have taste buds. If you want great food, coffee AND service, go to The Original Pancake House in Monona.
Visiting Charlotte from Los Angeles while husband is in town for business. The good: The upstairs dining room has a live band and lively atmosphere. People are talking loud and enjoying themselves. Have a drink before your dinner comes for an even better time. We each had a glass of wine. The sauce from the barbeque shrimp was the best part of our meal. Not the shrimp, the sauce with bread dipped in.The bad: Food is mediocre. We had the Cajun popcorn, which is fried crawfish that comes out partially covered in a remoulade sauce. Good, but on the salty side. Tell them to put the sauce on the side when you order so you can dip instead. The sauce took away from the dish and the ones that were smothered in the sauce remained on the place, uneaten. We each had a cup of seafood gumbo, There is no meat other than seafood in the gumbo (yay!) but it was bland and the rice seemed undercooked and flavorless. We ordered a large order of the barbeque shrimp and I got a side order of grits. The sauce in the barbeque shrimp was spicy and delicious; dip the bread from your bread basket in this tasty broth. The shrimp were on the small and limp side; not memorable at all as far as texture. The final insult: the grits. Grits are a favorite food of mine. I'm a southern girl and make real deal, bomb-azz grits at home. The grits at Cajun Queen were those instant, "add boiling water to reconstitute," grits. Culinary blasphemy.I will not return. If you want real grits, go to Mert's Heart and Soul.
So incredibly let down by this dining experience. Our waiter was simultaneously overbearing and absent-minded. Half of our table got their meals 10-15 mins before the other half and the waiter forgot to bring two of us our desserts. Meanwhile, the food was terrible. The fried green tomatoes lacked any kind of seasoning and the crawfish etouffee was bland and not at all spicy. The tollhouse cookie pie was also a travesty. How does one mess up a cookie pie! At least the key lime pie was good, but not worth the $250 dollar bill :(
Do not waste your money! The gumbo tasted like the roux had burned and there was no salt whatsoever. I ordered the blackened chicken to be safe thinking "no one can mess up blackened chicken".....I was wrong. None of the food (including the blackened chicken) were seasoned with salt and pepper. This was the most bland, overpriced food I'd ever had in the city. I ordered my toddler the chicken strip little gators meal. The fries were the best thing out of the entire meal. The service was as also dry and not very friendly or inviting from the hostess to the waiter, Brandon. Geez, I know it's a Tuesday night (we arrived at 5:30) but at least show some enthusiasm as I arrive to spend a whopping $123 (4 entrees, 4 alcoholic bevs, 1 kids meal) on a below average meal. It would've been more had we been charged for the uneaten cup of gumbo.
I take everyone that comes to visit me to Cajun Queen!  From the great food (my favorite is the bbq shrimp and bread to dip into the sauce), to the live jazz and great service, this is a restaurant not to be missed!
DISABLED PEOPLE, PLEASE BEWARE I've been a patron of Cajun Queen for over a decade but my experience tonight was humiliating. I treated my sister to  a birthday dinner and despite our online reservation, we were asked to leave in  the most demeaning of ways. I have a debilitating childhood disease and use a wheelchair on occasion ; tonight was one such occasion. I could only order food I knew didn't require cutting, so I opted for potatoes and a salad. My sister ordered a full meal with wine. I had two mixed drinks (so we're not cheap diners). We had to signal for another glass of wine for my sister, despite seeing the party next to us being served appropriately. I'm not sure why we were overlooked but I'm left to wonder if it's the small portion I ordered that was disparaging.Anyway, when my sister went to look upstairs a minute to reminisce, our server asked my sister quite off the cuff, "Do you want help with 'her' (wheel)chair I kinda need that table."Taken aback, my sister said, "No." We took note of the EMPTY tables on BOTH sides of us and the fact that the restaurant wasn't crazy busy as we remembered. I spent $67 on a tab for two  and left a TIP of $20--clearly more than twenty percent.I don't know many people who tip as graciously as I  do. My reasoning for leaving the tip despite the service, was it being Christmas time and it's something I do for goodwill.When we rolled to the handicap ramp, it was completely (I mean, completely) blocked off by an A-frame sign about parking; see for yourself. Had  my sister not been with me, I would have not been able to access the restaurant at all.I haven't  always been disabled and ran a restaurant, myself (loved every minute of it). I know how people can take advantage (campers) and I know people can be uber-cheap at tipping. I don't fall into  either ilk. I know good service when I see it; I know how to approach diners who overstay their 'welcome (their can NEVER be anyone who overstay their welcome; consider it flattery); it's part of doing business and keeping patrons happy.  Take a loss here and there. We were in and HOME in a little over two hours. The couple beside us with the adorable little girl who  laid all over the booth was fine by me; she's a child and CQ is a noisy place. I felt a sting of angst when I asked for my food to be wrapped. The facial gestures were quite unsettling.Please don't tell me I'm sensitive: I've had over FORTY surgeries--TWO with NO painkillers afterwards. I've walked on a BROKEN leg to buy wrapping paper tape been accosted because I wasn't 'messed up' "enough'" to ''deserve a handicap tag. So enough ---but there's  no excuse for inhospitably between diner and those needing  to use the facilities.''PLeASe let these be a isolated parents.'PLEASE LEAVE :)
Very loud, bad service, and the food doesn't met the expectations. We came w a party of 10 people, we didn't even get menus for a while, it was so loud we could hardly listen to our server. Dirty plates were sitting in our table for a long time. Super disappointed
if you're looking for a nice night out, keep looking...
I've never been to New Orleans, so I don't know if that makes me somehow less qualified to review this place.  But, I suspect a fair amount of people have never been to China, and it doesn't stop them from reviewing PF Changs.ANYWAY, the thing about NOTO whenever I have eaten there is that I am always expecting it to be way greater than it really is because of the way people talk about it.  I am always expecting this transcendent experience, but really, all I get is a styrofoam container of some spicy slop that really has no real flavor underneath the initial tongue shock of cayenne pepper.
I had the red beans and white rice with cornbread, dirty rice, fries. Not quite what my granny used to make. But the dirty rice was spicy and I added it to the bland white rice and beans to add flavor to it. It was ok buy upset my stomach. Cornbread was dense and moist Flavorless though. I wanted some warm buttery cornbread goodness. Nope. The fries and bbq sauce was all I liked in my order.
Can I give zero stars I didn't even get to eat. As soon as we walked in the cashier looked at us and walked in the back and never came back out. The cooks were outside smoking and gossiping about the night before's drunk. This was at 6 pm. Prime dinner time. The tables were all dirty. The visible part of the kitchen was messy and cross contaminated. Overall, we were flagrantly ignored. We left after ten minutes of non-service. I was very sad because I had heard such good reviews and the menu looked good, but the facilities were sketchy.
The prices are obscene they cook in nasty old grease we had the fish and shrimp both were awful and not enough a two year old could prepare better food! We were Very disappointed and will not be going back.
Some restaurants in this area have Chicago-envy.  That must be the problem with Radio Maria.  The fusion menu doesn't work because the chef has not mastered the basic cuisines that they are trying to blend.  Dishes are overly complex and are either bland or actively taste bad.  The staff used to describe it as a Caribbean-Polish Fusion.  (Really.)  I have no idea what's going on now.  Spanish-Korean  Soul Food Middle Eastern Style  Masa boats. Frog legs. Ground coffee rubs. Pad Thai. Torta.   The motto seems to be:  when in doubt, add more things that don't go together, none of it done well.This could only be mistaken for sophistication by people who have never been anywhere sophisticated.  Stay away!
Oh Radio Maria, how I wish we could be in love.Radio Maria is like the girl your friends try to set you up with.  You hear how beautiful, how wonderful she is.  Then you meet her, only to find out she bites her fingernails during dinner.This restaurant has all the makings of a high class experience.  It has a pretty bar with house-infused liquor.  (I especially love the ginger vodka.)  There is a large tapas menu, a full service restaurant, and even a hostess!However, that's where the magical journy ends.  You enter the restaurant only to be told to wait.  You may, if you're like me, point out all of the empty tables and ask "why can't I sit there"  "Well," says the snooty hostess, "those are reserved."  Really  You have half of your restaurant empty and those are all reserved  Ok, I'll bite.  Yes, we'll be happy to sit at the bar and have a drink and wait for "about 15 minutes."At the bar, we order two delicious drinks.  They're made well, even though it took a little longer than it should considering there were three people behind the bar.  We decided to ask for the tapas menu so we'd be ready to order.  Sure, I don't mind that this one has food spilled on it.  After about 20 minutes of staring at the menu, not having any contact with the bartenders and certainly not seeing our promised table, we left, paying only for the expensive, but tasty, drinks.Will we go back  Well....no.
I am giving this restaurant 0 stars.  I don't want anyone else wasting their money at this establishment. Here goes:My fellow students and I had organized a fundraiser to be held at R.M. We were raffling off some of our artwork and had ordered a substantial amount of food because we were expecting 50+ guests. Around 8:30pm, there was an AWFUL stench that filled the bar area, followed by a watery mist that began to fall from the ceiling along the west wall of tables. There were a number of people sitting in this area (myself included), who were covered in this putrid water (I had to go home and shower!!!). The food we ordered which was on a nearby table, was also covered. I alerted the manager who said to me "It must be our pipes again." Again This has happened to other customers The manager then called the fire department in to inspect the pipes running along the ceiling, while our guests (those who were left) crowded awkwardly around the bar.  The manager took no action in remedying the situation. Our food was NOT replaced, and the water on the tables and chairs was NOT wiped up, so that the guests could resume sitting. The artwork that was hanging on the wall was also damaged by the water, and was NOT compensated for. Radio Maria had quoted us for the cost of food prior to the event, but when we received our bill, it was over twice what they had quoted. Worse yet, the manager only refunded us the cost of one cheese plate. Thanks. You're swell.  This matter is still not resolved as the owners of Radio Maria seem to think they owe us nothing. I disagree, and until we receive just compensation, I will not be returning and hope you don't either.
I went to Radio Maria for lunch on my birthday with my parents, who drove in from out of town. It turned out to be the worst dinning experience I have ever had. Our waiter William ignored us during the entire time. He completely forgot our appetizer.  When I tried to ask about it with the other servers they ignored me as well. the appetizer finally came after we were done with our meals and our waiter did not even bother to apologize. The food was horrible. My mothers mahi mahi was the driest piece of fish I have ever seen. The portions were extremely small. The "sea food plate", a $12 lunch entree, came with ONE scallop, THREE tiny shrimps and a piece of dried up fish smaller than the size of two quarters. We were all so hungry after the meal we had to go to another restaurant for more food. When I mentioned my poor experience with the manager on duty, he started to make excuses and argue with me. He didn't even bother to apologize. Bad food, bad service. I will never return to this restaurant again. Not for lunch, not for dinner, not for drinks, not for salsa, not for anything. I will tell all my friends to avoid going there for get togethers from now on.
Just felt like adding the fact that I have traveld extensively through all of southern Spain and am very familiar with tapas. The food at this place does not remotely resemble anything I have had in Spain or any other good tapas restaurants in the US (New York, DC, SF, etc.). Everything lacks in flavor and freshness. Bottom line, hate it.
I'd hate to waste a star on this place!I lived right outside of The French Quarter in New Orleans for 8 months. I remember the best of Cajun food and this place was far from what I remember. I'm not big on seafood but everyone at our table ordered a seafood dish and all were not happy with their entree.What did I order I ordered a simple Chicken Po'boy sandwich. How can a Cajun restaurant get this wrong This place did. The chicken was placed on bread that was hard. I expected the chicken to be smothered in BBQ sauce. Wrong! The sauce was on the side. The lettuce on the side of dish that was to be used in the sandwich was a bit on the brown side. The fries were cold. Yuck!Waitress was great. She was the best part of this dining experience. Never again.
If you've ever been to New Orleans and have therefore been spoiled by actual cajun food, this place is a guaranteed disappointment. My $12 shrimp po'boy had maybe 10 shrimp on it, something that is supposed to be a staple of cajun cuisine. The couple of small pickles, half of a tomato slice and soggy lettuce given as dressings for the sandwich were an embarrassment. I'm not sure what flavor the chips were, because there was no flavor. I think I could have had better at Long John Silver's, and I hate Long John Silver's.
nothing to rave about this place.service was poor and the food was bad.I know, I shouldn't expect much on cajun food in phoenix. but I'm always up for an adventure.
Poor management ( young rude leadmanager lady. Line peoplecashier's are very nice and the chicken's really good too; but,  since the bathrooms and dining room is just nasty, I'm buying my food elsewhere! Just nasty and management is unfortunately very poor.
I love their food. But I won't go inside due to the poor cleanliness and bugs. So I opt for the drive thru and usually that works. But tonight was terrible. We pulled up and asked for a minute and then were asked a few seconds later if we were ready. Then a lady came onto the speaker and was so rude. So we decided real quick and she kept interrupting and getting the order wrong. When we finally got the order correct  we paid and they told us it would be 4 minutes. That was fine at least the food was ping to be fresh. They brought us our order and forgot our extra biscuits. When we went to go ask for them the same rude women handed them to us in a napkin. Although I love the food. I will not be returning to this location.
Ruined me and my girlfriend 4th of July got our food got home ate about 20 minutes later diarrhea and I know it was the Popeyes because it was very spicy and I got the spicy chicken tenders I am definitely making up for it today.
The coconut shrimp is tasty.  The tuna salad is really good.  However, most of the menu can be acquired at Red Lobster for about the same price and even better quality.  There is virtually nothing on the menu for a vegetarian.  I would not recommend this place to someone craving seafood, as the quality and freshness are questionable.  Go to Red Lobster instead!
Hahaha, this place is laughable. There is no thought what so ever in their menu items. Everything is far to repetitive; there is no texture, or no flavor. It gets old after the 1st bite. Literally, maybe even less. I'm not a picky person, and I know what good food tastes like. I don't mind tasting different foods, but if I ever had to come back here (if it was a matter of life or death [seriously, I'd only go if someone held a gun to my head and told me too... eh, even then I wouldn't] -) so we can forget about this sentence.The waitress was the valley girl of the west. She was always laughing, never made eye contact, pointed out something in the menu with a spaghetti arm, and said 'like' a lot. It was very annoying. She gave us our plates in the middle of our meal. She gave us our drinks towards the end. It was just horrible service overall. Unfortunately, I went to Sticky Fingers before this place. And if you compare the two, Sticky Fingers is so much better, and I felt so horribly miserable that day, because I had to end my night with food like that. The menu had cool drawings on it, which was the only plus side. I'm very happy to say that I will never eat here again. Ever. In my entire life.
Nasty! Disgusting. I can't believe I even stepped in the doors.
We had high hopes when we entered the restaurant.  The decor was over the top, but fun.  Unfortunately, this place was a disappointment after eating in Louisiana!  The seafood gumbo, or as the menu called it gumbeaux, was not very good.  One of my sons had the crawfish tails and he seemed to like them, but my other son ordered the seafood platter and 6 hours later he was violently ill.  Delightful.  We will not be going to Razoo's Cajun Cafe ever again.
We wanted to like this place, but had a horrible experience.  Our bartenders took a few minutes to greet us, even though we were the only guests at the bar and a few feet away.  We ordered a few apps, the pickles and the fried crayfish tails, and really disliked both.  The breading on the crayfish was mushy and salty, and the tails themselves were flavorless, textureless, and colorless.  The pickles would have been ok, but they were mushy as well.  We told our bartender that we really didn't care for the crayfish, and her response was to say 'Oh,' and walk away. We've heard a lot of people say good things about it, and maybe we just chose bad dishes or the kitchen was having an off day, but I was completely disappointed.  We may go back again and amend the rating, but I'll have to wait until I've gotten the awful taste out of my mouth.
NO MORE GATOR TAIL!!!! I used to love this place, their drinks were awesome, food is great, and the price isn't bad.  Now I have been informed they no longer will get gator tail.  No gator tail means i will not go back bummer
If you like being greeted in the morning by a gym worker slopping down eggs from a frying pany instead of working....this is your gym....complain to the manager and she gets nasty....try getting in touch with the owner....impossible!  Most unprofessional gym ever!!!!
Wait 20 mins for an elliptical. The weights are limited and they don't have a lot of machines. Oversold memberships. I just closed my over priced membership and joined fitness connection where everything is new and only 10 bucks a month. The Y is overrated.
I ate here with my husband as a convenient stop before we went shopping.  It's cafeteria food, people.  I didn't go in there thinking I was going to get a five star meal for $3.99.  I got the veggie pasta w alfredo sauce and my husband got the spaghetti and meatballs.  I couldn't even make it through half of the store before I felt super duper sick.  No more cafeteria food for this girlie.  Stick with the hot dogs and ice cream that you can get after check out....
disgusting, VERY very bland no flavor at all. Food is usually overcooked and cold from sitting out for so long.
Swedish Meat-flaws....I have tried this place a few times and it just upsets me every time. I love Sweden, lots of good things come from Sweden, Ikea rocks my world, Absolut is one of my favourite vodkas, Zlatan Ibrahimovic is a god, Massages and Saunas are also awesome, Tiger of Sweden make great clothes - and let us not forget the Swedish House Mafia!Peter's Yard is not on my list of good things to come from SwedenI heard they did great hot chocolate, I went in for one, I thought it was a bit m'eh. I trytheir cinnamon buns, again average, my housemate bakes better, and their sandwiches just seem to be trying too hard.Most of the stuff on the shelves is pointless, I wouldn't want to buy any of it - apart from the kiddies coffee cups, they are cool.I know this sounds harsh, but I get excited about places like this and it hurts when they don't come through with the goods.. I once ran across the meadows from my  flat to buy a couple coffees to go and some coffee beans, they told me to go next door - OK I get it, you have a takeaway place next door how about you go next door and get them for me As Jenny says, its overpriced also, and I don't care much for Artisan Flat Bread, thanks but no thanks.
Food is excellent-- 4 stars.  Service was terrible--0 stars.  Timing between all of us getting out main dishes was 15-20 (i.e. none of our main dishes came at the same time).  BTW, the name of this place is not great and from a marketing perspective, does not make sense.
WORST POSSIBLE SERVICE I HAVE EVER, I MEAN EVER, HAD!!!! This restaurant that was recommended to me by a friend who told me they serve poutine. I was super excited to try this place and being that I'm originally from Canada, I was looking forward to a little taste of home. I live in North Phoenix and drove 45mins to have "Poutine"Saturday Night August 25th - 4 adults, 2 kids - we walked in the door and the place is a mess. There was no where for us to sit. We stood around for about 10 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us. Finally they come to the front to clean up and start arranging tables to accomodate our party.  When we finally get to look at menus we realize that there are more then 1 size of poutine available. I head up to the counter to inquire about the poutines and the sizes... And that's when I am very rudely informed that if all we are going to have is poutine then we need to take it to go. They will not allow us to eat in the restaurant as it is Saturday night and one of their busiest nights and we cannot take up the much needed space. *** This is where I will mention that there was only 1 other table being used at the time*** I explain that we all want to have poutine and that we drove 45mins from Phoenix to come and try this restaurant... The person behind the counter didn't care. We were not to be served.Needless to say, we walked out, WITHOUT the poutine that  we were so looking forward to... I would NEVER recommend this restaurant! I have never heard of anyone turning away business because it was their busiest night, regardless of how much or how little we were going to order. Even if all we ordered was 4 large poutines that alone is $30, add in drinks.... Throughly disgusted with the lack of customer service.
My Mother and Daughter and I went to Beaver Choice for lunch.  We arrived at 2 o'clock.  They made no mention of the fact they were closing at 2:30.  We ordered, waited (a lengthy wait) for our food and began to eat.  About 8 minutes later a young man comes to the table and offers us boxes, telling us we MUST leave since they are going to have a meeting! WHAT We just spent 25 dollars and we are being kicked out  We tried to scarf some food quickly (my Mother is elderly and cant really eat in the car) as they were pulling the food and napkins and drinks off of our table.  This had to be the rudest experience EVER in my 42 years.  The food was NOT great and they charge extra for ANYTHING, like 50 cents to add mayo, without letting me know they were adding an extra charge for mayo.  WE WILL NEVER GO BACK!
I saw Beaver Choice profiled a long time ago on Eden Eats and always wanted to try it.  I was driving to work one day and drove right past the new place, and was so excited.  It is literally 3 minutes from my house and about 5 minutes from where I work.  Heck, I even emailed the owner to ask when it would be open.  And got a very nice email back too.  So last Saturday, me, my daughter and my friend went in and got seated right away.  The waiter was pretty good too.  Good startWe got the fries with cheese and gravy to start.  It was ok, but most importantly, fresh, and hot.  Then our dinner came, and it was a different story.  I got the stuffed chicken, mashed potatoes, salad and cole slaw.  My daughter got a hamburger, medium, and salad.  And my friend got meatballs, mashed potatoes and cole slaw.  The mashed potatoes were cold.  My daughter's hamburger was well done, and the bun was ice cold.  The dressing on the salad was tasteless as well.  Not horrible, but definitely room for improvement.So we have cold food and an incorrectly cooked meat.  But you know what the clencher was  We called the owner over and told her the food was cold.  She didn't say a word, and walked away, never to return.  Didn't offer to reheat the food, maybe throw in a dessert, nothing.  But she was sure greeting people with hugs when they walked in the door, prior customers I think.   You'd think she'd work a little harder to keep new customers.  After all, wasn't that why she moved, to expand her businessGuess what  I live close, and also work at a very close and large office building.  We go out to lunch a lot.  You better believe I won't be back, and won't bring any of my friends and coworkers in either.   There's never an excuse for poor customer service, especially by the "OWNER" of the restaurant.  A waiter, usually nothing to lose.  The owner has everything to lose.  I hope she reads this.
I ate at their Tempe location before they moved and had a good experience.  I was excited when they finally opened at their new location.  A friend and I went a few days after they opened and were looking forward to a nice meal.  We were prepared to be very patient because we knew that they were just opened and the staff were still learning.  It was a hot day outside and it felt stuffy inside, so we casually mentioned to our server that it felt warm inside the restaurant and maybe they could check the temperature.  Well, that is when the whole experience went downhill.  A minute later we heard the female owner speaking very loudly near the servers station that it was 76 degrees...it is 76 degrees, she kept loudly repeating that it was 76 degrees.  She then came over to our table and very rudely told us that the thermostat said 76 degrees, so why did we say it was warm  We just simply said that it felt warm to us and she then proceeded to tell us that we should get up and go look at the thermostat.  It was an extremely off putting experience.  Her tone and demeanor was very unfriendly and we felt like we had been scolded by our grandmother.  In my opinion, the food here is a little pricey, but has tasted pretty good when we have eaten there before.  However, my friend and I both felt afterwards that it is not a place that we would ever go again because of the attitude and tone in which we were spoken to. It is a shame, but you can't treat people that way and expect them to come back.  I hope they read this review so they can learn from our experience and prevent further damage to their business reputation.
HORRIBLE......price, service, food, experience.  WILL NEVER RETURN.  The doors were unlocked and there were people in there eating.  Then the owner came out of the back and said we are closed until 5 pm.  It was 4:30.  I guess proof that the service is horrible and slow was that lunch ends at 2 and they are closed from 2-5 but the couple at the table was still there eating.  Anyways they did let us come in and they offered us a glass of water...that took 15 minutes to get to the table.  When a server finally arrived through the front door all sweaty, he came to bring us menus.  Now it is 5:15. He brought us water and then started to take it away because we already had some, we asked him if we could keep it and it was a good thing we did as he never came back to refill glasses.  He never asked if we wanted anything else to drink and we were going to order a new kind of beer.  We ordered.  It was. 40 minutes before the first plate came and we had no silverware....when we asked the server said, no I gave you flatware already, really do you see any here another 10 minutes before the second plate came out and it was cold and was sent back.  There was a bone chip in the sausage.  At each table you could here the servers saying they were out of pierogies and then they were out of baklava, then they were out of......the owner lady started chatting at tables and told everyone she was out of pierogies because she only makes them on Tuesday her prep day..it was Friday.   So all the food must be leftover if she only preps on Tuesday.  VERY DISAPPOINTED, WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.  my one star rating is one star too much, but the lowest score you can give..
we have been wanting to eat here for quite a while and today we finally made it. We should have kept waiting. My wife had the schnitzel and I had the lox. Hers was just a slab of breaded chicken with what taste like canned mushroom soup. My lox, well I had 1 bite and that was all it took. It tasted like it was made 2 weeks ago and left in the fridge. Now taste is subjective and I realize that. What made sure I will NEVER go back to try something else is when we told the server I didn't care for the fish she  (eventually) took the plate away and charged for it anyway! If you're looking for something a little different I would strongly suggest you pass on this place.
Been wanting to try this place for a long time and finally got to check it out during Restaurant Week. Could not be more disappointed from the build up to the place to the actual food & prices, and the fact that the waitress seemed to take pride in telling us we could not have what we were asking for. We ordered off the restaurant week menu and I wish we had just tried the regular menu because it would have been much cheaper and we could have had a little more control over what we got. For example, each dish comes with a starch & 3 salads. For restaurant week, you could not choose the sides so I ended up with tomatoes with basil & a side of pickles. Pickles. 2 sides, not 3- one of which was pickles. But I'm getting ahead of myself. For appetizers, we got a lobster roll & poutine, which is French fries topped with cheese curds and gravy. The fries were freaking epic. The lobster roll was a hot dog bun filled with dill and a few fishy little langostinos. Entrees: schnitzel, a large, uneventful cutlet of sorts with various pickled veggies and copious amounts of dill, and some crazy potatoes that looked good but tasted like the inside of a pool supply store. I got something described as sliced meat over potatoes. Apparently this is Scandinavian for hockey puck on hospital cafeteria potatoes. Keep salting, you will not find the flavor. It is not there. Perhaps that's why they threw a pile of pickles next to it. I'll never know. I'll also never know where the bread is. I asked for some. Saw a lady with a slice. But the waitress, remember the one I mentioned earlier, who seems to take pride in not being the least bit accommodating, let us know that bread was only for people who ordered soup. Oh and the $8 kids meal! Can't forget the 12 cup of noodles covered in some kind of sauce that no child would ever touch. Supposed to come with a starch and a side but guess what- that doesn't apply to the pasta dish- so no French fries for the 6 year old but here- have some god damned pickled beets rolled in more dill. Every kids dream.  And now ladies and gents,  get out your bowl molds and jello no bake cheesecake, cause its time for some premade generic, gummy cool whip based concoction topped with jello. Jello.  We got cheesecake and something called lemon fluff. They were identical. Bowl mold shaped blobs of that foamy jello mixed with cool whip that you find at hillbilly bbqs. The only difference was that one tasted a bit more lemony & the other was topped with actual jello.Honestly, the more I reflect on our meal, the more angry I become. I don't know why anybody likes this place and I wanna punch the waitress in her neck tattoo. You wanna eat what i ate Save the $100 and go to the cafeteria of your local nursing home.
After reading the reviews and seeing the 4 star rating I was excited to try Beavers Choice. I went with a party of 9 people. We were all first time customers. Here's my Cons: The meal is all sides and a very small portion of meat. Approximately $15-$18 per plate, before tip. Pros: The pickled beets taste like my Oma's.
Food was ok but came out staggered.  Waitress was horrible.  Had to ask several times for refills .  they were out of root beer, sausage, asparagus. bartender was off duty. over all very disappointed.  Will never return--or refer anyone to come here.
Really dissapointed.  I was very excited to come here and was ignored for twenty minutes before I walked out.  We even had a conversation about how I was waiting for a menu and some serves before the owner promptly forgot a out me and went to serve someone else.
This place has THE WORST customer relations I've experienced in Pittsburgh since I moved here two months ago. My boyfriend was about to order a gyro, I was waiting for him at the table outside near the street with a drink and hotdog I had gotten elsewhere, there was absolutely no one else in their establishment. The person behind the counter then told my boyfriend that I was not welcome to sit at their outdoor seating area with him while he enjoyed his gyro. He canceled his order and we sat at the friendly place next door. Not only did Knossos lose my boyfriend's business that day, but they also lost both of us as future customers. What a petty and pathetic place.
Very disappointed. Delivery was late, our gyros were cold and fries were soggy. I wont be ordering from here again.
Awful poor excuse for a gyro. Food is always soggy. Meat is pure horsec*ck. Very unfriendly staff, but what do you expect from Greek fggots. Will never order from here again, total trash.
I have been here several times in the last year. The food is average...kind of fast-food-like. It sits in the warmer cases, and looks "crusty". The gyros are average, not as good as the ones at the South Side gyro restaurant, by any means.  The salads are from a bag of pre-chopped lettuce, and not "fresh" or interesting. But in order to enjoy the average food, you have to get past the really rude food wait staff.  The bartenders seem to be OK, the clientele in the bar seem to be regulars, and it is a "cheap drink" attraction to some downtown locals. The staff that serves the food, and takes the orders are out of this world rude. There is one that wins the prize for insulting the customers, and after having endured her, I will never, ever return. Owners should know how they are being represented at the front register. The man that cooks and plates the food is oblivious, or just is used to hearing her speak to people with such a lack of respect, that he is just deaf to it. Go somewhere else. It is cheap food, and you get what you pay for. I would pay twice as much, to feel like the staff gave a crap that I was there supporting their jobs.
Decent service...horrible food. I can't for the life of me understand how this company is so successful. It could only be worse if it was yet another failed Greek attempt at Italian.
Terrible! I'm just now getting over this horrible stomach bug caused by his place. I ended up paying $10.92 for a salad, water, and a small tiramisu. Needless to say, that price is ridiculous! You should never have to pay that much at lunch time for that little amount of food. Speaking of the food, in the salad, there was an egg and so I out it on a napkin because I don't like eggs. The waitress came by and asked how it was and I told her that I didn't like the egg. Instead of taking it or saying "hey sorry about that" or something to the effect, she just walked off. The tiramisu was awful, it tasted like someone tried to make banana pudding and failed. If you like tiramisu like I do, go to Olive Garden or SAMs club around Christmas. You will not be disappointed like you will here. Needless to say, I'm never going back.
Take it from me; avoid this place at all cost.  The only time I go is when I am starved and don't have the energy to cook or get edible food.  And then after I have been kicking myself.
All I can say is the worst! We were the only 2 people in the place for lunch, the place was freezing and loaded with kids toys! 2 bicycles, a scooter, and an electronic keyboard graced the dining room. A fish tank with filthy, slimy fingerprints smeared all over it is there for your enjoyment.Our food came... no water to drink, no tea, medium temperature food. Of course its cold, just like the room, I never took my jacket off! The plates are too small, you food spills over onto some semi-clean tables as you sit in your completely worn out booth seat. The fried noodles were out of a box and nasty, the shrimp was mushy, the fried rice was bright yellow.We asked for water, they brought us 1 in a SOLO cup for 2 people. I asked for hot tea, they said 10 minutes. What Chinese restaurant does not have hot tea available upon requestOver all.... my first and last visit to this place. The only good point was that it was cheap, and deservingly so.
The worse "Chinese food", even the white rice which came with the ogle sweet and sour chicken is really bad.  Please don't eat this food.
I hate this place.It's very loud, the service is very poor, and the food is so-so.If you want good Chinese in Pittsburgh, try China Palace (Shadyside) or Sesame Inn (Station Square or North Hills).  They're quieter, with very good food & service.
Honestly, I'm furious. I enjoyed PF Chang's restaurants in the Chicago area, and my wife and I have eaten a few times at this Pittsburgh-area location. Over the last year, we have tried repeatedly, but the 90-120 minute wait for dinner is unacceptable. We tried going early, late -- it never made any difference. The front staff was rude, and the wait was too long.Tonight, we had a special date planned, and made reservations a week in advance. We came in the door exactly on time, waited in the line to see the front staff, and we were promptly handed a pager. They couldn't tell us when we would be seated.I imagined a short wait, so we went outside, crossed into a store to wait (since the entrance of this location is so packed, it's impossible to wait at the bar or in the meager seating).After 20 minutes we gave up. We went back to PF Chang's and the front office staff still couldn't tell us when we would be seated. I saw open tables.What on earth is the point of accepting reservations if you do not honor themThe food here is good, but certainly not great. We went to a local Thai place and were seated with no problem in 5 minutes. The food was much better, the service was good even in a crowded busy restaurant. Oh, and the local place was a much more reasonable price.We certainly will never visit PF Chang's again.
This was my first time at this PF Chang's and I was not impressed. The service was extremely slow even though it was a Sunday night and the restaurant was not very busy. The portions were small. They were also playing 5 year old pop music really loud. Pop music! Come on--this is an "Asian Bistro."
Rude unwelcoming short haired black hostess. Drinks were not good. Greasy spring  rolls Below par on every way.  No experience needed to work here
Walked in tonight, Wednesday, at 9:50, the place was empty. Asked for a table, the hostess told us one moment when she finds one for us, then proceeded to walk to a dirty table and clean it!  The phone rang and she answered it as we stood at the door. When she hung up the phone she walked back to the table and proceeded to clean it again!!  Didn't say a word to us. Unbelievable!  Will not be back there-- rude hostess!
We went last night Saturday night to P.F.Chang located at the Kierlands in Scottsdale. Terrible Experience!!! after waiting over one hour to be seated, we ordered calamari for appetizer which came with a horrible strange salty sauce and salt and pepper mix on the side. then I ordered beef and broccoli and my husband ordered a vegetarian dish with peanut sauce . After a long wait my food came so salty that I could not even eat and as much as I hate to complain but I had to let the waiter know, so he went to get me one with less salt. My husband's dish was OK. then the second one was a bit less salty but the meat had a terrible liver kind of taste which totally turned my stomach. I feel the reason they added so much salt was to hide the bad tasting rotted meat. Very bad experience. Our waiter was kind and sympathetic. ruined my evening out :(
Let me start off by saying I have mostly simple tastes, and my favorite lunch spot for Chinese has been the New Dumpling House in Squirrel Hill. But since that restaurant is undergoing renovations, I was forced to try something new.So... I thought I'd try the chain PF Chang's Chinese Restaurant at the Waterfront. Wow, what an unsatisfying mistake that turned out to be.I started with a cup of their Wonton soup. At $2.95 it wasn't too outrageous of a price, the broth had some flavor and there was much more in it than I was used to, including three giant basil (I think) leafs that covered everything beneath. In the broth were chunks of chicken, two shrimp, some sliced water chestnuts and two "pork"-filled wontons. As I said, the broth had decent flavor, but the wontons were thick, doughy and under-cooked, and the chicken chunks were dry, which is amazing since they were drowned in broth! On a scale of bad to good, it was kind of meh.Next came my "lunch-portion" order of Chang's Kung Pao Chicken (the dinner portion is $5 more). At the New Dumpling House, this dish is served with a delectable dark, rich, tangy sauce, which I was really hoping for... Not at PF Chang's. On my plate I received about 8 quarter-size chunks of lightly breaded and browned chicken, 7 hot Chinese red chili peppers (mostly inedible unless they are diced into a sauce), a handful of blanched, unsalted peanuts, a few sliced scallions, and a bed of the most bland brown rice I have ever encountered. Uncle Ben would've been ashamed if that stuff came out of one of his boxes.Glaringly, there was NO SAUCE!. None at all.I've had Kung Pao Chicken in New York City, San Francisco, and even from a hole in the wall in Bethel Park, PA that was much, much better. Never have I had it served in such a bland, skimpy, and overpriced way! The "lunch-portion" cost was $9.95.At The New Dumpling House, I could have a delicious lunch, with soup, entree and complimentary hot tea, and I could leave satisfied with just $8 out-of-pocket -- and that includes the tip.The service was decent. However, lesson learned. One and done. Never going back to PF Changs.
Delivery is slow and not even close to the best Chinese in the area.  No matter if it's rice or noodles or chicken or pork, everything tastes off--like it's been overcooked in mop-bucket-water.  Try House of Lee instead.
Wow. What a shame. My family just moved to the area and have been sampling the local cuisine. We are a very large family and love foods of all kind. We've eaten Chinese food from a hundred different places in a dozen different cities. Hands down, this was the worst we've ever had. Cold, tough, congealed, and tasteless - that's the only way to describe it. I'll never order from here again. Quite frankly, the fact that I took time away from my kids to type this out should tell you how awful it was. My complaints fell on deaf ears. I guess they were shocked that someone thought that they were serving low grade dog food. I understand that sometimes restaurants crank out bad food. It happens. But when it does, you bend over backwards to make it right. Not at this place. I was told that he would have to speak with the owner in order to help me. I guess that's how they deflect complaints - blame it on the owners that aren't there and make the customer for away angry.  Too bad. Because we will be visiting a competitor in the future. This family of 7 won't be visiting China Sea ever again. Oh, and by the way, why can't I give this place zero stars
The pros:You get a TON of food for your money. If the food was actually decent, this would have been even better because... LEFTOVERS. They have coupons on their website that you can use whenever. The cons:The woman who answers the phone is kinda rude. You try to ask her questions and she gets an attitude with you like you're wasting her time. My pork dumplings were "fried" only on one side and were raw in the middle. Everything was pretty darn salty. Yeah, I get it. Chinese food tends to be a little salty, but this was unacceptably salty. Leftovers... Yes this is also a con because I threw it away. Suffering through it once was enough! If you're craving something made fresh that is spicy and sweet, you're not going to find it here. Just very greasy, very salty, poor excuse for Chinese takeout.
Tasteless food that arrived over an hour after it was ordered and was cold.  Will never order from here again.
Never received my order and was left in a bad mood. The driver did not carry GPS for delivery, did not know my address which is right in squirrel hill, did not listen to me (or did not understand me) when I tried to give him directions, asked me to pick up food from an intersection 0.3 miles away from my apartment in snow, and finally yelled at me to cancel my order. Cannot comment about food, but whatever experience I had left a bad taste.
I really feel bad about giving a one-star review.  First, it's not about the service, price, decor, or the food.  I'm writing this review after going there twice.  The first time my husband and I went, the dinner was good.  We thought this place has the potential to be our go-to Chinese restaurant in Pgh.  Today I remembered that they have an early-bird special 3-6pm (m-sat).  The won ton soup was not authentic (more like chicken noodle soup) but wasn't bad.  The entree was fine.  What really knocked the score down to 1 is the awful tobaccocigarette smell from the tea!!  !!   I had to go to the grocery store and buy a pack of gum.  The smell wouldn't leave me so I came home to rinse my mouth with Listerine (2-3 minutes) then brush (as long as I could) to get rid of the smell.  Did they use the tea pot as an ash tray  [first visit: 3 stars] + [second visit: -5 stars] = [ -2 stars]
Closed.  Signage down.  Boarded up tight.  Phone disconnected.
Horrible - they use chicken that's been out uncover all day . And they smoke around the food.:(
I've been practicing bikram yoga for about eight years and have had the opportunity to attend classes all over the US and abroad. It's always fun to try a new studio and experience new teachers. Unfortunately, Bikram's Yoga College of India in Central Phoenix was one of the worst classes and studios I've ever experienced. The smell of the studio was so absolutely disgusting (dirty, wet dog combined with urine) that I nearly lost it when I walked in. I opted to stay because I really wanted to get a class in. On top of the awful stench, the teacher sucked. She had us hold poses longer  the second time through and shorter the first time. Many of the students had really poor technique (I know, you shouldn't worry about others...it's your own practice), however, I thought it was an indication about the poor quality of instruction.It's unfortunate the hygiene wasn't up to par. It's bad for bikram and damn, it's really inconvenient for me. I travel to PHX a lot and I love to grab a class. Well, I'm going to try out one of the other studios in town. Thank goodness they've got some competition!
The carpet is completely unsanitary and a breeding ground for MRSA. The instructor only verbally ran the class, never demonstrated one pose OR even made rounds to correct those doing them wrong. Lots of people that hadn't done yoga before because of the groupon and it's unfortunate they have been thought incorrectly. This instruction method is going to cause people injuries. FYI never do a jerking twisting motion with your upper body to try and square your hips!!! The instructor even told me and another girl NOT to drink water at the moment we did! So not OK, always listen to your bodies needs.
All I can say is thank GOODNESS I paid $15 for this Groupon!  This place does not even deserve a one star! I recently moved to the Phoenix area from California and have been searching for a good yoga studio. I LOVE Groupon and was happy to see several studios I can try out before I purchase a membership.  I have been practicing yoga for several years and have never been so offended during my yoga practice. While I understand that there is a particular flow for HathaBikram yoga (which I prefer Vinyasa Flow), I always try to push myself a little farther with what I have learned in my previous practices at different studios. In the middle of class, I attempted a slightly different pose from what was being taught (without interrupting my fellow yogi's) and the teacher called me out in the middle of class saying "Can you please do the same pose as the rest of the class" (in a derogatory tone) I was absolutely offended by his gesture so I rolled up my mat and walked right out of the class. I sincerely apologize to the other yogi's there for walking out in the middle of class and interrupting their practice but he could have been a bit more tactful with his approach. Perhaps pulling me aside after class and letting me know this was not okay with him would have been more appropriate. So rude! Perhaps it was rude of me to assume I can try and progress my yoga style during his class but I always had encouragment from my previous teachers for pushing myself to evolve in my practice.In addition, because of the Groupon, the class was extremely packed and there was no room to move or do the poses correctly.  Also, the studio has carpet (which is different than what I am used to) and it is really disgusting! Sweaty, dirty, nasty and probably filled with bacteria. eew! I was already planning on looking for another studio and this incident made me look sooner!I will never visit this place again and will never recommend this place to anyone. Take my advice and keep looking for another studio!
Im very sorry that I spent money on a groupon before attending a class but alas, you live and learn. The staff is very rude especially if you had purchased the groupon (THE NERVE!) because apparently, you need to know ALL THE BIKRAM. Not a good place for beginners or anyone with a sense of smell for that matter. The carpet really is a health hazard and I left feeling sick from the stench. The instructor didnt bother to take one second to explain things carefully or slowly, just reciting the poses SO FAST it was hard to keep up. How can one relax and focus when they dont know what to do HORRIBLE. I wouldn't ever recommend this to anyone. Sick.
Oh geeze I loathe this place. It smells like a sweaty swamp full of mold, yeast, day old balls and other unidentified bodily odors. The fluorescent lights blare while the instructors yawn and fan themselves with the list of asanas they repeat session after session ad nauseum. Did I mention it's also 100 degrees and 95 percent humidity in there You will also huddle together as there is always a groupon bringing in the hordes. Don't worry, you will be able to see every inch of everyone's nearly naked body for only a few minutes as the mirrors quickly fog up with your collective sweat.
Do not go here! This place simply nasty. I have been to any hot yoga classes and this studio is by far the worst. They have mold and such a stench that lingers through the entire place. Honestly, made me sick. It is so unkempt and dirty!I would never suggest this place to anyone.
Smelly, moldy and just plain gross! It is difficult to say you're doing something healthy when you're staring at the ceiling and all the mold is staring right back at you... The yoga itself is great however it is hard to get over the unbearable smell of sweat that slaps you in the face the moment you walk in.. I'm sure there are better places to try in town!
I've taken hot yoga from many studios in Phoenix, and this is by far the WORSE.I'm pretty sure the instructor Dawn has A.D.D. She couldn't seem to focus on the class. The class was in shambles. Everyone of doing different positions, it was ridiculously unorganized. Dawn would start counting down a pose, then forget about the class and start doing her own moves in the mirror, then remember about us and start counting down again at a totally different number.She'd put us in a pose, then start random chatting with people, and totally forget about us. It was a total waste of time. Speaking of time....the class is scheduled for 1hr25min. I think the class is soo long to schedule in Dawn's day dreaming. The class started almost 10 minutes late, and went WAY OVER 1hr25mins. I was ready to scream! Thank god I only went there on a $20 coupon. I'm never going back.
My friend and i drove 25 miles to get to a yoga class at 2:00pm, we get there 5 minutes late and they did not let us in.  We did all we could to get there on time and the lady at the front desk asked us to leave and to arrive on time next time.  I asked her since we drove such a long way to come to this place can we get in  She still said no.  I felt so hurt at all the effort we put in.  She was looking at us funny because I am Mexican and my friend is Black.  We have both practiced yoga for a while now.Since then, I will not got back due to poor customer response.  I will not recommend this place to any of my friends.
OK, for starters... I'm all about handstands and arm balances. Also, I believe that yoga is about listening to your body and doing the pose that is right for you.  Therefore, if your in a pose and you think you should go deeper than do it!  When I go to a power class and I'm told not to modify and the teacher is overweight, I get scarred that it's going to be a bad class.  Also, power yoga should be taught by type A people. You can be mellow and spiritual, then teach a restorative class. Enough ranting!Yoga Pura has a nice vibe, but for starts it smells like an old gym, where are the air fresheners and sage folks Wow!!  The people there are really nice, but the Manger that teaches power should only be allowed to teach level 1 Flow and Restorative classes. She is a very sincere woman and a had a great spirit, but she should not teach power!  Her class was so bad that I barley broke into a sweat. We spent 40 mins in ansana for an 85 min class!!!! That is nuts for a power class. I understand the owner Eric is awesome, but he needs to look who is teaching his more advanced classes. Yoga has changed and people are more advanced. This studio is behind the times.If you want a great yoga studio in Phoenix, then your best option is AtoneYoga! Enough said.
I went into inner vision and the man at the desk was soooo rude I was shocked. He was kind if an older fellow with salt and pepper hair, I think he is one of the owners but wouldn't swear to it. Anyway, I've always thought of the place as this calm zen kinda place but this guy sent such a negative "get the hell out of here" vibe I'll never be back. There are so many yoga places springing up customer service with a smile is very important. I personally will take my practice to Sumits.
meh... it was ok hot yoga.  hard to find.
This place would be great if it was actually hot and humid like it should be. I bought a groupon that ended up going to waste. First class, instructor was really nice but I barely broke a sweat. I thought I would give it another shot but the 2nd time I walked out completely dry. This place should just be called warm Bikram yoga. I think they need some humidifiers or something because their heaters just weren't cutting it.
Went with my husband for dinner around 8pm on a Saturday evening, on a livingsocial deal I recently purchased. This was our first time at a hibachi place. Upon entering, we were asked whether we wanted to be seated at a regular table or a hibachi table. We were told that at the hibachi table, we could order only hibachi, but at the regular table, you could order sushi as well as hibachi ( or, I suppose, anything off the menu). Since I came in with the intention of ordering sushi, we asked to be seated at a regular table. A few minutes after we were seated, however, I decided that I would do hibachi as well, and the waitress promptly moved us to a hibachi table.  2 other couples were already seated there besides us.I ordered the shrimp and salmon hibachi, and my husband got the chicken and shrimp. Each entree came with a small salad (with some awesome dressing!) and a cup of clear (mushroom) soup (again, very good). Once everyone at the table was done with their soups and salads, out came the hibachi chef. Very entertaining fellow, we had little broccoli florets popped into our mouths from a distance,and saki squirted into our mouths. At one point, he shut off the lights at our table,  and performed some setting-things-on-fire show! Each hibachi dinner includes grilled veggies, noodles, fried rice, and of course, your choice of meat. There were also two little bowls of sauce for everyone ( one was a ginger flavor, the other peanut I think). Everything was delicious, and the portions were big. I got around 8-10 jumbo sized shrimp and a nice chunk of salmon sprinkled with sesame seeds. Both of us couldn't finish all of our dinner, and we had them packed. We also ordered the banana tempura along with a scoop of vanilla ice cream . Beautifully presented, and the ice cream was particularly rich and tasty, not your usual blah vanilla. The severs were attentive, and very friendly. Overall, I would definitely come back. Great food, great portions, great service, and thoroughly entertaining, what's not to love!
What a great addition to the area. The Sushi Room has always been in my top choices when it comes to sushi and the addition of the Teppanyaki tables and the rebranding were a great upgrade.The bbq short ribs were pretty good and the teppan was also really good. And fair prices which is always a plus. I had the filet and it was well executed. The soup and salad were also excellent. Friendly chef, professional staff, all in all a great experience.The fried rice was above average.My only suggestion is the music selection. I mean at 6 pm still a family time and listening Madonna's "I touch myself" is not what I appreciate when I go out with my kid. (at least the volume wasn't that loud and the lyrics got lost).Just a disclaimer. Although there's room for improvement, being the first week as a teppan it really deserves the 5 stars and I'm sure in a couple of months they'll tune everything up to have a solid concept.I'll be back for sure.Cheers
Just came back from eating here and I can honestly say that the rainbow roll was one of the best I ever had.  The service was very good as well.  This place is situated in a nice location where you can have your pick of a few nice restaurants.  Rock Lobster (fka The Sushi Room) is one of them.  Bf was with me and had the salmon.  By the look of his clean plate, he must have liked it.  Bf then ordered the chocolate lava cake, and although very rich tasting, bf didn't feel too heavy afterwards -- a definite plus for him and me!!:)
Love the makeover! Restaurant is extremely clean, decor is well executed, and staff is not only fun and friendly but also professional (which is hard to find). Teppan chefs are hilarious and I most certainly award the "dinnertainment" with five stars. I tired the fillet and scallop combo and it was top notch.
Incredible food and service. The happy hour specials are so worth it. The sushi was fresh. The presentation was amazing. Service was prompt and friendly. All around a great experience for us. The flavors were very good and when we had questions about certain fish they brought out a sample for us to try. We really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere and would highly recommend this place to anyone in the Chandler area.
First time here after getting up and leaving the table without ordering at Hon Machi Sushi (that review later). The Sushi Room is now Rock Lobster, same restaurant, new name. We went on Sunday, which happened to be Happy Hour. It included rolls, drinks, appetizers. Presentation of sushi rolls was excellent, food was fantastic, and service was great. Atmosphere was very nice! I will be coming back!
I enjoyed the Sushi Room but love the new make over to Rock Lobster with Teppan tables.  Tried the Teppan menu and love the fried rice and balance of seasoning with fresh shrimp and chicken.  Of course, the sushi rolls are still a personal favorite.  My recent happy hour was fantastic now that the weather has cooled and the patio is an option again.  The staff is friendly as ever and the music play lists include many of my favorites.  Check it out!
Excellent service and delicious rolls! Haven't done the Teppanyaki yet but it looks and smells amazing...I may have to sneak a sit at the Tepp table on way out! Highly recommend!
Cuisine for both meals was very amazing. Turn around time was exceptional. Presentation was fabulous. Wait time was only a few minutes. Over all a very solid experience and we will be back.
Upon further review the call is overturned to 5 stars! Thanks guy's! Like I said great atmosphere, great food , really cool employees..
Just love this place! The sushi is the best in the east valley and NOW they have teppan tables. The chef Hieu can really entertain both young and well....mature! Good is consistent and delish!
Wetzels's Pretzels is definitely amazing and very crave-able. I am pretty boring when it comes to pretzels... I like them plain with salt. No dipping sauce or weird pizza flavors for me. Wetzel's offers delicious plain pretzels and bite size wetzel bits as well which are perfect for sharing! Also if all that salt leaves you feeling thirsty try their frozen lemonades. They have regular and cherry, but usually ask them to mix them for me. Snaking perfection!
I LOVE WETZEL'S PRETZELS.  My husband and I will come to the mall specifically for Wetzel's and nothing else. We'll make up an excuse to go to the mall and then be all like, oh yeah, and let's get a pretzel while we are there. We always get the bitz and they are so soft and fluffy. Lately the ones on the bottom don't seem to get as much butter love as the ones on top, but that's what I save the pizza sauce for.
Sooooo good!!!! Way better than Auntie Anns although Auntie Anns is not bad. I love the plain pretzel (butter but no salt) with cheese. Sooo much butter and cooked to perfection at Wetzels. I watched the girl making them too and she was a pro! The hubby and I can't help but to get one of these when we are wandering around the Chandler Mall which is usually after having dinner at a place in or around the mall and going to see the puppies at puppies of love. That tells you how much we love these pretzels. We are usually already full but we have to get one anyways!!! My new motto: "There is always room for a pretzel!"The only thing I have noticed is that these are a bit slow. Not sure why when they have everything already made and all they have to do is grab it and give it to you.... hmmm
Best mall pretzels. Better than Auntie Anns! They are very doughy and buttery (which I like). My friend got the pizza pretzel and said the dough was not like the pretzel dough, so I would not recommend that one. My kids always ask for them at the mall, it's hard to say no because I want some too.
I love love love their huge unsalted (and cinnamon sugar) pillowy soft delicious pretzels. I am a big fan of soft (and hard, for that matter) pretzels- great snacks unless they have too much butter. I just don't like salt too much. Pretzels can be a healthy alternative to other mall choices provided it's not soaked in salt and butter. The other pretzel companies try to outdo Auntie Anne's but I really don't think that they can. Jeez, craving one as I am typing up my review.

This is THE BEST place to eat in Pittsburgh.  I wish I could give this place 10 stars.  I love pretzels!  I love this place.  I love that they won't wait on you if you are talking on your cell phone.  I love that lunch is less than $3.My second favorite food to pretzles is probably rice krispie treats - and they sell those too.  LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!! I am adding some pictures of fresh pretzels!
After having had a terrible pretzel from the Reading Terminal in Philadelphia, we happened to park right in front of this shop when we were going to explore Carson Street. You walk in and there are just pretzels behind the counter, kind of like what we're used to seeing with bagel shops here on the West Coast. Each one was $.50. You can't beat it. We shared one since we were on an eating mission and it was a darn good pretzel. Lots of locals inside just grabbing pretzels here and there to go.TY wanted to take some back to LA, so we asked how well they kept. We were told that you could take them back and throw them in the freezer, but since we were homeless, having checked out of the hotel already, we had to forgo any extras.
This is one of my most favorite places in Pittsburgh.   I love pretzels and these are way better than the ones from the mall that are dripping in butter.  The pretzel sandwiches are less than $3 and a great lunch - not too much food.  I also like this place because it is one of the few place you can buy rice krispie treats.  This is just a great little neighborhood shop, that makes a great pretzel for an amazing price.  When they had to raise the price to $.50 they even posted a sign apologizing and explaining the price of the ingredients had gone up.  I definitely would put this on my list of places to eat in Pittsburgh.
If I had a weakness, it would be the Pretzel Shop.  I'm there all the time!  Even though the shop is tiny and you can't eat inside, there is always a line to get food.  Sandwiches are no more than $3.00 and they have great cookies, muffins and desserts.  Seriously, a couple of slices of meat and cheese between a sliced pretzel NEVER tasted so good.
Ok. So you're in the mall (I'm sorry for you, really I am.) you smell that salty baked pretzel smell and suddenly you think going to Auntie Anne's is a good idea. You're wrong. Dead wrong.Hold out for some Pretzel Shop love. The place is not only easy to find being right on East Carson Street in the Southside of Pittsburgh, but it has the absolute cheapest and FRESHEST pretzels ever. The downside, you can't sit down to eat inside and there is always a line. Honestly neither of these deter me as I am perfectly happy being a stoop-dweller and taking up someone else's front steps to eat one of these salty snacks. The line just tells me that it's worth it. The prices literally are rock bottom. Don't miss a chance to get something, even just to take home, from here. Delish.
As Pittsburgh as Pittsburgh gets.Not as cheap as it once was but I love these pretzel sandwiches.Everyone should stop by and get at least a pretzel. You will love it.Line can be a little long around lunch time but it moves fast.I like the chicken salad pretzel the best.Also get a cinnamon and sugar pretzel.
The Pretzel Shop is a Pittsburgh classic.  I would give the quality of the pretzels 4 stars, but when you factor in the low cost, and quaint set-up- this place gets bumped up to 5 stars.  It's a great place to stop by for a pretzel sandwich on a Saturday, for a breakfast sandwich (any day but Sunday), or to get a ton of soft pretzels on the cheap if you have people coming over.  All in all, the Pretzel Shop is a must-go if you are in the South Side.
Cheap, great food, family owned, wonderful employees.  The service is always with a smile.  The daily specials are great and they are conveniently located with extended business hours!
Amazing! Don't waste your time with the sandwiches or pizza--all that stuff just gets in the way of the main event: the pretzel! Best pretzel in the city.  Best anything in the anywhere. Cheap, too. Only complaint: not open late enough.
The Pretzel Shop is one of those unique places that every city has. A wonderfully extra thick pretzel cut in half, slathered with sauce, and topped with your favorite pizza toppings, a pretzel pizza, screw the low carb diet!  Or, take the same pretzel, cut it in half and pile on turkey and cheddar, or ham and swiss, and you have a great sandwich with the extra crunch of salt from the pretzel top. What else do you need Grab a sack full or a dozen or so pizza pretzels take them home, pop them in the oven and you have a great meal for the big game. I love this place!
This place should have a lot more reviews - but I'm glad it doesn't, they don't need to get any busier.Its been there ages, and looks it. If you're all about ambiance, don't bother. If you pretend you're in a movie set in Pittsburgh 30 years ago it works pretty well. The service is sometimes hit or miss. Most of girls are good, one is very slow, one is amazing. They are all friendly and usually a few different people will check in to make sure that you're happy. Everything is made fresh so be prepared that nothing comes flying out of that kitchen - busy times it can take a good while to get food. The food is AWESOME! Worth any little complaints I might think up before it gets there. Once its on the table, I forget them all.-Fish Sandwiich-Salmon (huge and delicious)-Flounder-Shrimp a few ways ("Norfolk" style is oily for my taste, and I never had it growing up in Norfolk.)-Hawkins St Special-Prime Rib (sized for two, watch it)The prices are low, the portions are large, and just about everything on the menu  is delicious. I'm not one to pick a place because they give you a lot of food, but if you like a good value and don't want to compromise on taste, this place is a gem.
Old school.....traditional "mom 'n pop" quality and perfection. The best fish and chips you'll ever enjoy and equally superb fried shrimp. A great out of the way, non-corporate, vestige of Americana. You will love it.
Seen this restaurant on 25 best places in Pittsburgh with Rick Sebackack. Went there with my girlfriend she grew up with the owner. She's very nice all employees are super nice service was excellent i had the fish sandwich my girlfriend had the Ruben more than you could possibly eat very reasonable prices. Going back to try the burgers  i heard there enormous and very tasty.
Good fish sandwich.
After a morning of Thrift Store hunting, a friend and I were thinking of lunch, and he suggested Emil's after he'd seen Chris Sebak do a bit on it and had tried it a time or two before, and I had not. He said they had a decent Reuben, but to be prepared to step back in time.Well, seeing as how I'm kind of addicted to late 40's and early 50's, and the whole Rat Pack scene, stepping back in time is a welcomed change in da burgh...as long as it doesn't involve 1979, which I can see all around me every day.And yet another shot at finding a decent Reuben in da burgh...well, that's like hunting the Holy Grail. So looking under one more bush certainly wouldn't hurt.So off we go right at lunchtime in the middle of...where exactly were we At first I thought we were lost, driving around a handful of very rather dismal looking blocks in what looked like a neighborhood that had been blighted by the building of a highway. And then...AHA! Here it is! And yep, there it was. This little unassuming building with an add-on entrance with what looked like a very old hand painted sign stating quite simply 'Emil's. We walked in the front door, and entered another world. Another time, and another place. Oh, and any Big BurritoSousa foodies might as well stop reading now. I wouldn't want to see you walk in, roll your eyes and say 'Reaaaaaalllly'This is about as old world barloungerestaurant as it gets. Plain, with a dark wood bar on one side, plain white walls with no yinzer pics, good sturdy chairs and actual white linens on the tables. This is the kind of neighborhood dive that I could see Frank and Dino pulling a few tables together for some poker, a fish sammich, and some cheap scotch. And THAT is exactly what I love.Oh...but good food counts too. We each had a Reuben, and my friend had a side of fries. The Reubens were decent, but not NY awesome. A little too thick on the bread, but overall, tasty and definitely filling. Not too skimpy on the meat. I seriously CRAVE a true, good NY Reuben, but since I can't afford to travel right now, what I find in da burgh will have to do. But as we sat and ate, burgers came out to an adjoining table. Those were some big thick burgers. A steak went past for the table behind us. That was HUGE! And when we asked about it, the waitress said 'Yeah, it's huge and really good, and he only charges $12.99 for it, ain't that nuts' Another table of five came in, and wham. Fish sandwiches PILED with breaded fish that looked amazing. Yeah, I want that, that, that and THAT!My friend also mentioned that they have a Chicken Parm special one day of the week that is only served UNTIL 4 pm, and that it is fantastic. If only I could GET there on that week day before 4...The waitress did a good job, especially since there was quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a Saturday, and only one of her. She kept up and was very friendly. They only have Pepsi products, so I had a brewed iced tea, which was very fresh, and she did pop by to ask about refills as often as she could. As the lunch hour went on, they were getting busy.Emil's is no frills, good portions, very reasonable prices, VERY comfortable neighborhood hole in the wall...kind of like Cheers, but in a blue collar neighborhood in the 1950's. Fan-freakin-tastic! I could feel at home here.You definitely want to hit Mapquest or plug in your GPS though. I am not sure that I could find it again on my own...it really is a hidden gem. I will be making my friend take me back until I can memorize where the heck it is.Addendum: 2nd visit for the fish sandwich. Excellent. Truly. A pound of fish on a fish-shaped bun (as opposed to da burgh's seemingly popular hamburger bun). The fish was flavorful, the batter excellent, and for just $8. This may have been the best fish sandwich I've yet to have in da burgh.
Had a great experience with Frank and his team.  It was our daughter's Sweet 16, and it was perfect.  They walked us through all the things we needed to know, and helped us from the first phone call to the last song.  It really helped to have them reassure us that they would entertain 60 kids, and we didn't have to worry!  The light show is a must.  It took the music to a different level.  I recommend Windy City DJ's for your needs.  Don't be afraid to ask questions, because they've done it all and can help you with a lot of details!
We hired Ray the DJ after extensive dj research for our wedding. There are so many bad djs out there that we wanted to be sure. Ray the DJ has very competitive prices and Brenda who is in the main office is terrific. She answered all of our e-mails quickly and was always very professional. We hired Marcus from Ray and he was awesome!! He meet with us before we even hired him so we could find out about his background and experience. We loved Marcus right away. However, at Ray they give you the chance to choose a different DJ in case you don't "click" with your first DJ. Marcus was very professional and played all the songs we requested and provided us with great suggestions. After the wedding we got so many compliments about our DJ. For any brides out there looking for a great DJ I would highly recommend Ray the DJ and Marcus.
Ray made our wedding reception absolutely phenomenal! He timed all of the little special requests perfectly (like me surprising my husband with a groom's cake). He read the group on the dance floor perfectly and because of that, we didn't stop dancing until our time ran out. He even went along with a surprise our friends had for us that called for a certain song. Could not have imagined that night as perfectly as it turned out. Thank you Ray!
Jeremy at Ray the DJ was simply fantastic. I met with at least 6 other DJs before finding Jeremy. Not only were his prices $250 below all the others, he was friendly, professional, knowledgeable, and went above and beyond to ensure I got what I wanted. He offered several add-ons to my package, but never pushed. He communicated with me regularly and gave suggestions, but never tried to steer me away from the music and vision I had for my reception. I loathe the cheesy DJ thing, and he was the epitome of class and professionalism. My guests danced the entire time, and that is the true mark of a great DJ. You will NOT be disappointed with Jeremy at Ray the DJ!
The decision on the DJ for our wedding was made the moment we met with Jeff from Ray the DJ.  He is older for a man of his profession (not a kid in his 20's that you'd expect to be working as a partyevent DJ) but it didn't take long for him to win us over.  The man is all charm and character.  We could tell that he really loved music and what he does.  I almost wanted to pull him out from behind the turntables, sit down, and have a few drinks with him. He couldn't have been any better at the reception.  He played everything we asked for, flowed perfectly with our timeline (including working with us to finish some schmoozing before moving on to the next part), He could get our guest's attention but never tried to make himself the star of the show, and he knew how to keep the party going.  The only negative thing I can say about Jeff was that he took an awful request from my new sister in law (but in all fairness to him, she wanted to dance with her husband to their wedding song, so I can't blame him), but he quickly recovered as soon as the track ended.  Probably with the exception of that song, people were on the dance floor until the final song.
For our wedding, we were very wary about DJ's because we had been to many wedding where the DJ absolutely sucked.....well not this company!Our DJ was Mike, and he was awesome! We met two or three times prior to the wedding just to go over everything, and Mike made sure that he had all the correct info. My dad STILL says how great he was, and our wedding was over 2 months ago! We constantly heard how great he was from many ages of our guests. I would recommend this company to anyone looking for a good time.Mike also was the MC for the wedding, and he did a great job! No complaints in any way at all! Their website is also very very helpful when it comes to picking songs. We weren't picky about songs, and chose to trust him when it came to the music, and boy are we happy we did that! Like i said before, everyone loved him!!! Great job Ray the DJ!
Chad is amazing! Working with him was more enjoyable than I thought working with a DJ could be! He made the entire process a breeze from initial consultation to our Last Dance. Chad has a unique and amazing ability to read a crowd and energize a group in just the right way to ensure each guest feels included in each moment of your event. Chad embraced our non-traditional song choices and offered valuable suggestions during our planning to make our event extra special. With Chad, you're not just getting a DJ - you're gaining a fun, fresh, funky friend who will masterfully guide each moment of your special day to make sure that it reflects you're vision and personality - as well as that of your guests, and infuses both into the greatest party you'll ever experience! Chad lays out the planning process in easy to follow worksheets and provides a wealth of suggestions, both on paper and in person, to make sure you are able to craft an event that reflects energy, enjoyment, and personality from beginning to end. I would recommend working with Chad on any event where you're looking for an experienced and talented master to be your Director of Fun!
I can go on and on about Chad!  I can guarantee that he'll be the best DJ you'll ever work with!  We hired him for our st. pattys day wedding this past year and our guests are still talking about how much fun they had on our day.  If you want a creative, fun, not typical wedding entertainment,  Chad will be your guy!  He has many ideas to make your day fun and stress free.  When we first met him, right off the bat you could tell he is a very professional, organized, yet a kind hearted guy.  So easy to work with that you'll want to plan another event so you could hire him again.  We miss our day and the entertainment made our wedding day so memorable!!
If you are looking for a personalized, tasteful, romantic reception that becomes a rockin dance party - go with All-American DJ. My wife and I film weddings and have worked with them a lot, and the people have so much fun; we even notice it later when editing the video.
No Complaints with this place! Support the little guy, (last mom and pop shop)  and if you ever need anything repaired this is the place Vegas!
We used Limelite to rent the audio and dj equipment for our wedding in Vegas a few weeks ago and we couldn't be happier with their services.  They set up for our ceremony and the reception. Our out-of-town DJ was more than pleased with their equipment. They were accommodating, responsive, professional, on-time, set-up was smooth, and they are extremely affordable.  Thanks to Ed for all your efforts. Great people to work with! Highly recommended. If we or our friends ever have an event in Vegas, we will surely use them again.
I am a huge fan of this store, in fact I'm not sure it's a store... it's more of a community! If you need DJ equipment, they can definitely help you out and their rates are lower than what you'll get at Guitar Center. Plus, they will work with you to make sure you get what you need (and want). They also sell DJ lights, not my current needs - but good to know they have it.The community aspect is that they offer free sessions to introduce extraordinary world of DJing to newcomers. If you're looking for digital DJ tips, go on any Tuesday from 4-6pm. Or, if you're into learning more about the classics... vinyl (old school DJing), visit MC Audio on Wednesdays between 3:30 and 7:30pm.They are great at igniting (or re-lighting) the fire and motivating people to keep at it. I plan on visiting them regularly!
My husband and I used SKM for our wedding DJ, MC, and videography.  We were thoroughly impressed with their professionalism, timeliness, and organization during the planning.  They were always one step ahead of us and made everything so easy for us.  We loved our MC, Chris.  He was very friendly and attentive to what we wanted at our reception.  He really took control, and we were worry free all night.  He kept checking in to see if I needed anything, which was very nice.  All the guests had a wonderful time at the wedding.  He had everyone on the dance floor and no one wanted to stop dancing.  The DJ, Gavin, did a great job with the music! I highly recommend both of them for your event.  We also booked our videography, David, for a great price.  We are waiting to get the video, but know it will come out great.  He stayed the whole time and even interviewed my grandparents.  I can't wait to see it.  Thank you SKM for making our night go so smoothly.  You took great care of us, and we got to just enjoy the night, our family, and friends.  Thank you!!
These wonderful people did our wedding this past March and I just have to say it was an absolute joy and pleasure to work with them! Miles and his group were very accommodating and the flow of the wedding was fantastic. We had people come from all over and my cousins in Florida commented how great of a time it truly was! I couldn't be more happy. And to see my wife's face throughout it all...that was my joy. Thank you so much to these great people! I like how they were always consulting with us and kept it stress free. Pricing was perfect and spot on. We were able to pick and choose a custom package and the sound was awesome. It was the best I've ever seen and I would have no problem referring these good people to anyone!
SKM was one of the best choices we made for our wedding.  I was worried when first selecting them because they are a bit pricey, but after meeting Nathan at a bridal show, I was intrigued enough to set up a consultation.  My husband and I were immediately impressed with how thorough they were in the planning process and booked them despite the cost.  It was totally worth it. Nathan (our MC) was super helpful with all of my planning questions throughout the process, even answering annoying texts from me the week of the wedding with last minute questions.  He offered great suggestions for timelines and songs for events.  The event itself was spectacularly run. The two-person team was flawless.  All of the transitions from tradition to tradition were well handled.  They coordinated with all of the other vendors well and with the guests.  Nathan consistently checked in with us to make sure we were having a good time.  He was involved with our guests, asking them what they wanted to hear and actually playing those songs (My uncle leapt out of his seat when Brick House, his choice, came on).   Nathan learned important people's names and used them at the wedding.  He involved guests at all stages so there was never a dull moment.  He even got out on the dance floor and taught guests the wobble.  Our guests raved about SKM and their experience.  SKM definitely made our wedding unforgettable for us and all of our guests.
Skm rocks! Very organized and professional. Nathan was amazing as our MC! I would recommend this company to anyone for any event! We'll done.
Jimmy D with Starz Entertainment did a fantastic job providing us DJ services for our wedding and reception. Jimmy D has a great and well-deserved reputation in the DJ community. We are lucky we were able to hire him to DJ our wedding and reception. He has many years of experience and it shows. He was energetic and super professional in every aspect of the planning and execution of our wedding and reception. He answered our emails immediately and met with us several times before the wedding to make sure we had everything set up the way we wanted. He spent hours before and after, setting up to make sure the lighting and sound was the best it could be. He had great suggestions for songs and activities and helped make our wedding and reception absolutely perfect. It was seamless, and everyone had a great time! We highly, highly, recommend Jimmy D and Starz Entertainment for DJ services!
Jimmy D is the best DJ that you will find in Arizona! I attended a wedding that he DJed and he did such a great job that I booked him when I got married 4 years later! He gets everyone up and dancing, there wasn't a single person in the room who wasn't dancing once Jimmy opened the dance floor! He is so fun, charismatic, and extremely professional. I highly recommend anyone who is looking for someone to entertain guests of all ages, who can control the energy of the room, and who is easy and delightful to work with!
Jimmy did an absolute amazing job as our wedding DJ. It's the only wedding I have ever seen where the dance floor was PACKED all night long. Not only was his playlist amazing, his ability to keep everything organized and on track was very key. We actually didn't have a wedding planner, and without Jimmy there to basically run the show, I'm not sure what we would've done. His assistant Carie was awesome as well. She played a really key role in keeping everything up to speed and organized. We would highly recommend Jimmy and Starz Entertainment!  SUPER IMPRESSED!!!!!
A before our wedding, the DJ we had cancelled on us! We were freaking out to say the least. It got worse when our second cancelled as well. I guess he double booked and we were cut loose. I wanted to give up and just play an iPod. But luckily, I was referred to Birkett Entertainment. Our DJ was Tony and to say he was perfect was an understatement. He reassured me that he would be there on my special day no matter what! He was so detailed and really got to know what my husband and I wanted. I had many guests tell me there was not one song they didn't like on the play list. I would recommend tony to anyone! I can't thank him enough for all he did.
Birkett Entertainment is truly phenomenal! Chris goes above and beyond what you can imagine. His attention to detail, creative innovations to make any event special, and memorable is a work of art. He touches the lives of so many people. I would highly recommend working with his company for all your DJ, and entertainment needs. His company is the best! In addition to his business, he puts on the most phenomenal Halloween extravaganza, and magical," winter wonderland ". Incredible!Cliff Gaines-A 1 Studios
So I'm a Dad.  I'm a picky Dad.  I've been to a number of young kids birthday parties in the Phoenix area and they leave a lot to be desired.  I'm not talking about complicated stuff here.   Sure the kids have fun at some organized events, but how about the parents as well  I'm so tired of the allotted two pizzas to serve 15 kids and adults that I could cry.  Maybe it's because I'm a food guy.  Feed me well and I'll be happy.  I don't know, but what I do know is that Toy Town is the best destination for all your 5 and under kids birthday party needs.  We rented the facility for 2 hours on Sunday.  Cake was arranged through their custom cake maker.  A half sheet of  cake for $50 and it was a well made and delicious cake too.  The good news for me is that I'm still enjoying the leftovers.Back to Toy Town.  So it's a kids play place basically.  Set up like a small town.  Each little house in the place is a different business.  Police Dept, Pizza place.  Hospital and so on.  We had 20 kids and as many adults at our party.  All the kids enjoyed it, from our 1 year old to the 7 year olds.  The girls were playing dress up with the clothing from the different houses.  There is a small bounce house in the back that everyone liked.  As per their standard party set up, we ordered Dominoes pizza from right next door.  This ensured that everyone got as much food as we needed.  We had a great time.The kids all played with all of the toys in the place, we all ate pizze and then cake and everyone enjoyed themselves.  the staff here is wonderful.  They work to make sure that everything is smooth for you.  they handled the few things that we didn't think of and the party was a great success.  Many of the mom's were discussing their future partying plans with this facility in mind.  The only thing that they could improve would be their front entry area.  It is a bit crowded and needs to be reworked for smoothness of store entry.  Beyond that, everything is exceptional.  It was very easy for us to arrange this party, everything was handled well, from the place to the cake and the pizza and drinks.   We were very pleased and will be coming back.
Hello All, I am just here to give some information about Toy Town. The new owner just took over in July of 2012. If you have suggestions such as the ones below. (hours, toys your kids love but they need more of, etc.) Please go on facebook http:www.facebook.comToyTownPlaycenter or their website http:toytownplaycenter.com and suggest them to the owner. I know her very well and she would be more than happy to here your feedback about the place. Thank you!
Fountain Hills is an oasis in the desert, marked visibly by its world famous namesake. Quiet and serene, the town feels like a entirely different world bordering the hustle and bustle of some of the larger cities in the phoenix metropolitan area. A golfers paradise, Fountain Hills offers multiple highly rated courses with greens worth the drive. However golf isn't the only reason to cross the border into town. Local eateries provide a wide range of style, price range, and atmospheres to choose from. In addition, twice a year, the town becomes a mecca of arts and crafts enthusiasts, when it hosts the Fountain Hills Arts and Crafts Fair.While its reputation leans towards that of a retirement community, Fountain Hills has proven a wonderful place to raise a family. Tight knit school systems provide the foundation to promote long lasting relationships between students and faculty, while ensuring a multifaceted education. With well maintained parks, local sports organizations and outdoor enthusiasts can enjoy a safe and beautiful place to participate in a variety of activities. Jungle gyms and small water parks provide hours of entertainment for the whole family. Fountain Hills is the well needed escape from the growing concrete jungle surrounding the phoenix area while still being tuned into the culture and vibrancy of the cities it neighbors.
Stayed at The Palms and my husband and I really wanted to use our complimentary passes for the Drift Spa together.  We took a mini tour of the place (my son is 18 months old) and he immediately found a ball to play with and got on the slide.  There was enough to do to keep him busy for hours. Books, cribs for naps (wow), video, toys, snacks, etc.  We left him for 1 hour and he was happy as a clam while we were gone.  There were 2 other kids and 2 employees. Amber was very friendly and let us know that our son will be in good hands.   I brought our own diapers, sippy cup and wipes and they labeled everything as to not mix it up with other kids' stuff.  I am sure they have the supplies if you don't bring your own.  It was $8.25 per hour on a Sunday afternoon. The only bummer is that we should have let him play there for another hour and enjoy the spa a tad more.  To be honest, Kids Quest may be one of very few reasons to stay at The Palms.
Homeless in the park! How unheard of! Not really, folks. It may be unappealing for you suburbanites who choose to live within the confines of a tiny box, but not for me, a born and raised city girl who has adapted to urban culture and diversity. I love this park, and have been going here for years. It's small, quiet (on most days), and green. I go there when I don't want to deal with crowded parks like Sunset. Actually, I have mostly given up on Sunset and replaced it with Paradise. :) The way these people make Paradise out to be is totally not what it really is. I say, check it out for yourself. If you prefer grass and matured trees over the dull gravely desert landscapes found in these newer 'homeless free' parks, or you just want to get away from crowded parks, but still want to enjoy the greenery, then Paradise is the place to go. I have had a lot of peaceful picnics here. Never had a problem with homeless people (who I've barely scene) or drug dealers (who I've NEVER seen, and I've hung out here late at night to have some wine with friends.). I mostly picnic on the Northeast side of the park. Lots of shade, grass, and beautiful big trees to be enjoyed. :)
Freestone Park is a must-visit if you live in or near, or are visiting Gilbert. The 100-acre grounds are beautiful, featuring a man-made lake and waterfall. An 1880's replica miniature railroad takes a quarter-mile loop around the lake, affording a views of ducks and geese. Bring some bread if you dare (the ducks can be quite aggressive!).There are numerous picnic armadas, several separate playground areas -- so if one play area is being dominated by a snot-nosed bully, you can always move to a safer one. There are also basketball courts, sand volleyball pits, batting cages and a driving range, and a 22,000 square feet skate park.But wait! That's not all! There's also an antique carousel, mini-ferris wheel, and a tot-sized "wave runner." Although there is a fee for the train, batting cages, golf & the rides, it is on par or below what other equivalent amusements usually cost. Finally Freestone Park is an excellent place to slide down grassy hills on an ice block. Of course, that activity isn't officially sanctioned, so try-at-your-own risk :)
This park is amazing! I just recently moved from Mesa to Gilbert and boy...what a breath of fresh air to see the town put so much time into community. I was recently studying for a big test for work and I would come to this park during the daytime to sit outside and read. They have picnic benches all over the place and while school is in session, it was pretty quick on a weekday afternoon. Plus, its absolutely gorgous. Seems like it would be a great place for a family-oriented afternoon.
AH-MAZ-ING.I love this park. Too bad we met for the first time during my final week living in Phoenix. Otherwise, this park would have become a regular staple in my active life. Walking...running...basketball...tennis... They even have baseball cages and a skate park! Now, I probably wouldn't have done either of those, for fear of offing myself. But, hey, I love to watch and having both around brings a very cool vibe, you know The walkingrunning sidewalk meanders around nice, calming waters. There's even some electrical outlets near the picnicplay area. So you can fire up the ol' laptop while you watch the kiddies play and chase each other around. So awesome. If I ever were to buy a home in the Phoenix area, this is the first place I'd consider - near this park, which is quite big for parks in Phoenix and, as mentioned before, offers an array of very fun things to do. Heck, there's even a path to ride horses on!Here's info on the skate park: http:www.ci.gilbert.az.usparkspopupsskatepark.cfmEnjoy!
Freestone park weather is almost here!Pry their cold dead hands off that video game console and get them outside for some fun!From the train, to the ducks, fishing, the clean picnic area's or the batting cages and carousal there is something to do.Been here with my family and nieces and just in general while going to gilbert schools, always a nice experience !The nice weather is almost here!
FAVORITE PARK YET!  You just have to be happy when you are in Freestone park... at the entrance there is a mini CARNIVAL with the cute ferris wheel, merry-go-round and kiddie train w railroad track that loops the entire park !  Make sure to watch the sunset on top of one of the formidable hills ... the carnival area lights up at night, which is really quite precious.  Its a huge park and happens to be celebration central... at least two quinceaneras and one wedding party there on a Friday afternoon.  Really lovely. Great place for a picnic and ICE BLOCKING, which is still just as fun as when you were a kid!  This park actually has hills tall enough for decent ice blocking :) *Don't forget to pack some bread to feed the smelly ducks in the lake*
I ride my bike through here most mornings listening to the hum of the power lines. This park has just about everything too. The batting cages are always fun.
This is a great park. It has a lot of room and a lot of open grass areas. If you are looking for a place to use your Summer Sled or go Ice Blocking, this is the place. The hills a steep and long. They also have several playgrounds and a train that goes around Freestone for the kids. On the East side of the park they have some softball fields, batting cages, and a skatepark. Everyone can have a good time.
This is one of the best places to do parkour.  I recommend this place for its various obstacles. This is a challenging place to work out.For families this is also a good park. The kids train and amusement park rides are neat and cost a small fee. You frequently see professional photos being taken here. Good for sports  activities. They even have a skate park and a large round area for meetings, like an old outdoor theatre set up.  However, I've never seen it used there. I've only seen it used for award ceremonies.Overall, this is a very multipurpose park.
Living in Gilbert has a Few Perks & Freestone is near the top for sure! If you need to get a run in, need to relax and feed the ducks, or just need a place to take the kids to release some energy this is a FANTASTIC place to go! The fact that they have Volleyball Courts, Batting Cages, Basket Ball Courts & Baseball Fields.... Makes this a VERY easy 5!
This park is beautiful! My son and I just had a photo session here and it has some amazing backgrounds for pictures. The lake, waterfalls, bridges, trees, it has a little bit of everything. It has a cute little "play" area for children, it has a carousel, a train that travels through the park, little boats and a tiny ferris wheel. You do have to buy tickets to ride the rides, but it's not too expensive. You can get a sheet of tickets for like $16 and that is enough to go on all the rides a few times! It is a cute little place to take your little ones. It is quite large so there is enough space for anything you're looking to do. There was a huge birthday party on one side while we were there and a wedding going on on the other side. I will definitely be going back to enjoy an afternoon with my little fella!
This awesome park and recreation center makes me wish we lived in Peoria. We were here today for a FRAG (reef tank geeks) picnic and the whole area is new and beautiful with lots of different amenities. We saw sand volleyball courts, a spashground (with critters spouting water) for the little kids, a skate park packed with older kids, picnic ramadas, fishing areas, baseball fields, batting cages, and a duck pond. There is even a Starbuck's.We were at the group ramada BBQ pavilion, the likes of which I have never seen before. It was a huge covered circle of about a dozen BBQ grills with ventilation hoods hanging above and a cement "bar" from which to serve on the outside circle and smaller cement "tables" behind on which to do prep work. There were also sinks in the center to wash up. Surrounding this circle of grills were corresponding ramadas with picnic tables numbered for your group. What a fantastic set up! Great job, Peoria!
Fun for Everyone! My daughter had a softball tournament here and the facilities are awsome! They have everything you could ask for out of a community park. For example, softballbaseball fields, batting cages, skate park, rec center gym, sand volleyball courts, splash pad, and they even have a few fishing ponds for those wanting to relax. I also saw that they had teen dodgeball tournament going on in their rec center. They probably have some more stuff to do there that I didnt get a chance to check out cause this place is huge! They have a baseball store and a Starbucks also! Very cool place.
Great place to hang out everything from fishing to batting cages even indoor rock climbing
I want one! Peoria, please talk with Charlotte about making another community center just like this one on the east coast.My nephew reserved a racquetball court. While he and my husband played, I scoped out the place. Talk about impressive! From rock walls, Wii games, and ping pong to weight lifting, basketball courts, and an indoor track, this place has it all!They offer computer use and free wifi. A Starbucks is across the parking lot next to baseball fields. A fishing pond is just outside the facility. In addition, they have conference rooms that I'm sure you could rent out for your special occasion. The facility was giant, clean, and remarkable. The staff were very courteous and helpful.I'm envious and I want one where I live. If you are a Peoria resident, you are very lucky! They offer extremely reasonable memberships for residents and great guest prices too. If you don't have your own equipment, you can rent it for $1. Can't beat this place!
I continue to be impressed with this community park and recreation center. I spent a morning and afternoon with my family at the park area. It was perfect! There are ample spaces for eating, BBQing, and playing. There's a fun water area where kids can spray each other. The bathrooms are kept very clean.Since I was here last, the Starbucks has closed.If I had a large event, I would want to host it here. Great entertainment for the entire family!
awsome gym, close to work, nice staff, CLEAN.   you can fish here too.
I love Rio Vista. It is a huge park fully equipped with a recreation center, skate park, volleyball nets, baseball fields, etc. The scenery is absolutely gorgeous. Being a amateur photographer, I love to bring "models" here so that I can shoot them. The park is really nice and kept up.
Great park! Me and my boyfriend came here to have a picnic. Of course I referred to Yelp before making any decision on which park I should go to and this park popped up. At first I was hesitant because there weren't a lot of photos but the reviews were good. I was pleasantly surprised and happy that I did end up coming. The park is huge! They have a skate park, a volleyball area, and baseball areas. They also have a good trail to ride bikes or go walking. You can even go fishing! And the major plus is that this park is really clean!There are a lot of picnic areas and places to grill. So if you are looking for a family outing or just a relaxing day this is your place!
This is such a beautiful park! I won't reiterate the amenities most of the other reviews have pointed out, but the rec center is really clean and there's a lot of activities inside as well. I have yet to take advantage of their trails and picnic areas, though I will definitely make it a point to do so!
These are great baseballsoftball fields!I'm not a City of Peoria resident and I don't visit this park for anything other than my son playing youth baseball  - both in club baseball and district little league tournaments.The Rio Vista baseballsoftball fields are some of the nicest, best maintained fields in the valley.  It's obvious the city cares about this park and their sports programs.  The grass is always green, cut and simply wonderful.  The infields are well maintained, well striped and watered, with one exception - the pitching mound on Field 7 has deteriorated to the point of being a pitching bump.  As of June 2011 It's far from the 12" height required for Little League play.  That being said, it's still a nice grass infield to play on.I've had the opportunity to work with the staff at Rio Vista park too, just to communicate baseball scores during District 2 little league tournaments.  The staff is a joy to work with.Thanks for a wonderful place for the kids to play baseball!
Def a favorite park of mine here in Vegas. It's very calm, and out of the way. Very spacious. There is a diverse playground for kids, a number of athletic fields, bathrooms pavillions and barbeque grills. Really everything you could want from a park except maybe a fountain or something, but hey, it's the desert!
So, let me first say that yes, I was a bit tipsy when I agreed to go on a ghost hunt. But apparently I was not the only one. We arrived at the park to find other ghost hunters already waiting. We decided to join forces and wait it out together. The story goes that around three in the morning, one of the swings on the playground starts to move and you can hear a little kid singing. The haunting is documented on various places on the internet, and is considered one of the most haunted places in America. Huh. Didn't even know that until that night. I probably wouldn't have gone if I did.Anyway, so we waited a bit, and then maybe because we were tired and still pretty hammed up, or maybe because it was true, we saw the swing move!! Unbelievable!! Then it stopped. And I wish I could go on with the story, but that's the end.But if you are bored one night, I really recommend checking it out because if only for the heeby jeebies, it's worth it...
I wish NoVa had a place this size and this beautiful! We did four trails in about 2 hours and saw turtles, fish, birds of all kind! There were picnic areas with BBQ pits along the lake. I loved it!
Great Camping Amenities, Friendly Staff, and Waterfront Views. It is beautiful this time of year, and a chill way to spend a day. I especially love the trails, there are so many! It is the only campground in Mecklenburg County, and I just wish there were more like it!
Great place to go year round!I hike here all the time and love it. There are lots of short trails for quick hikes and you can loop a few together for a longer hike. Tons of picnic tables and lake scenery. Hiking and kayaking here is great. The nature center has some good displays as well. If you're lucky, you might catch a glimpse if some wildlife!
Short drive to a peaceful getaway. Pack a picnic, grab the pooch, and get ready for a great day.One of my latest Mecklenburg County discoveries is McDowell Nature Preserve. I love walking trails and getting absorbed in nature and this place fits the bill nicely. Beautiful, well-kept up place making you feel as though you are miles away from anything when in reality it is minutes from the city. There is a great campground to bring your tent and stay the night, a playground for the kiddos, many picnic tables, and plenty of trails to walk for miles. You can even fish, but there are signs posted that say caution because the fish may have a high dosage of mercury. If you are planning a reunion, this would probably be a great place to host it. Rent one of the areas, let people camp out, you are right next to the lake to rent kayaks in the spring and summer...you've got yourself one great family gathering spot!The Nature Center was closed when I was there, but I'm sure one of these days I'll stop in.
Great place right in the city, which will take you away from all the busy city life. The nature preserve has numerous hiking trails which are marked and some are good 2 to 3 mile loops. It has picnic tables and grills right besides the lake. Great place to take your dogs for a hike or running on the trails.
Love the nature trailsAnd the beautiful picnic areasA great place to take the family
Just south of the state line not far off of the Carowinds exit lies one of the Charlotte region's hidden gems, Ann Springs Close Greenway.  The term "greenway" here is used as meaning a "nature preserve", unlike the most of the greenways in Charlotte which are paths along creeks.  ASC Greenway is a 2300 acre privately owned nature preserve, owned by the SpringsClose family.  They made a fortune in textiles (we have some Springs towels in our house) but merged with a Brazilian compnay a few years ago and most, if not all, of their local mills are now closed.  As development was beginning to encroach the area, the family decided to leave this piece of earth to be undeveloped - and to also be used as education for nature and the environment.The headquarters of the Leroy Springs & Company www.leroysprings.com is an old house dating back to the 1700s and was once occupied by the family.  It's the type of house that looks like it would be haunted and you'd see on Ghost Hunters.  The house sits at one of several entrances to the greenway.  This is the one near the "dairy barn".  Springs Farms used to sell milk, and this is where the cows were.  Though you can still see a few cows roaming in the field, the dairy barn has been converted and is now used for hosting events - including weddings.  There are also some horses, goats, donkeys, and mules near this entrance.The greenway has many trails - all of which are open for walking, and some which are shared for horses and mountain bikes.  There are a few lakes, one with a nice one mile trail to walk around, campsites, animals, historic buildings, creeks, a small nature center, the original "Nation Ford" road which was a covered wagon trail, and a lot more.  There are often kids events, bird watching walks, and other events like their annual Earth Day celebration which is each April (the ASC Greenway opened on Earth Day so it's also their birthday).Daily admission is a mere $3 for adults.  At most entrances, you put your cash or check in a pre-printed envelope and tear of the tab with numbers that match the envelope, and place said envelope in a drop box.  One of the entrances is also usually staffed.  The daily admission gets you unlimited access to the trails, but you must be a member to fish.  Also, the only entrance for bikes is behind the Leroy Springs Rec Center which is a little further into Fort Mill.ASC Greenway is an absolutely beautiful nature preserve with a lot of history in it.  I'm glad it is very close to mi casa, and I never get tired of going there.  You can easily spend a day here hiking, biking, etc, so pack a picnic and go check it out.
Donated by the Springs family, the Greenway is 2300 acres of beautiful nature to be enjoyed by all.  Located in Fort Mill, the Greenway offers guests the space to mountain bike, hike, jog, camp, canoe, fish, or ride horses on the many trails offered.The Greenway charges a single day fee of $3 and monthly and yearly passes are also offered.  The Greenway is open at 7 AM and closes around dusk.I love going to the Greenway!  It's always nice to get a breath of fresh air...and there's alot of fresh air to be had at the Greenway.  Bring your dog for a walk.  Take your kids on a nature exploration.  Take some horseback riding lessons.  No matter how you choose to use this beautifully preserved bed of nature, you're sure to enjoy yourself!Try:  A smaller hike with the familyAvoid:  Three-Leaf plants
This is a great place for a hike or a trail-ride and very affordable too. I know someone who had a wedding in the barn (yep, she's a horse person).  The barn wedding & reception would have been ok (it's a really nice barn) except that at the time it wasn't air-conditioned and was a litte too warm.   If you are not into barn nuptials, the Greenway still has lots to offer!
Count me in as a raving fan. This is 30 minutes from my house and when my wife and I want to hike, the choices are slim. The greenway in Charlotte isn't really hiking, Cane Creek is kind of creepy and Kings Mountain is a bit out of the way for us. This hits the spot. Lots of history, great historic buildings, NOT crowded, in minutes we were on a trail by ourselves and able to enjoy the beauty of the area. The best part, is they receive NO tax dollars. All supported by donations and contributions. We will be regulars.
We are so lucky to have a spot like this to enjoy with our kids! We have been out for Earth Day, the Fall Festival and many random trips in between and just love being surrounded by the (mostly) untouched natural setting.
We tent camped,mtn biked,hiked did it all.  Had a big time will be back.The mountainbike trails were awesome.  all the people we met were nice friendlyhelpful.
went back mtn biking again loved it, was a bit muddy but we have had a lotta rain...the staff was great to speak with, and was even watching some guys dog. ..while he was mtn biking!!!  I hope he gave her something (a nice tip) will be back with my bike any time  I am here..Loved it!!!! trails need better markings only negative.
A hidden gem with relaxing scenic views, historic homes and plenty of walking trails. I was very surprised with how large an area this park encompasses, and so you would want to be prepared if you plan to visit. Great place for families and couples. Quiet and not over crowded. My husband and I went to this place on Saturday afternoon and we couldn't ask for a better place to unwind from the busy life and connect with nature, one on one.
What can you say negative about this place Miles of waking, Mtn biking, and equestrian trails. Combine that with a small creek, a few ponds, some primitive camp sites with a bath house, and a few additional bonuses and you have a great place to spend the day, afternoon or simply an hour. Very lucky to live within 5 minutes of this jewel. Highly recommend this place especially for families!
I drive by this place every single day going to work.  For the past 8 years I've always said, "I need to stop in here and check it out".  I did today.  I put my big boy pants on and decided to go for a walk  hike with my family and friends.I'm glad I did.  What a great spot....we entered at the trailhead at the parking lot, picked up a map and went exploring.  There are many different trails at the main location that you can choose some just hiking, some bikes and horses.  They give you the mileage and away we went.We walked for a few hours.....we encountered spiders, snakes and a lot of mountain bikers which was all great.  We had so much fun.  Funny, when you're walking you forget that this place is not far from a roadway since it is such a great spot of land.They ask for a donation to use the facilities but the box to put the $$ is wide open and not locked so I didn't feel comfortable leaving my $$ and info on an envelope, they should probably change that.  It was a gorgeous day, we got outside and had an absolute blast
I visited the Aldo LeopoId Nature Center in Monona, WI yesterday, 09-06-14. What a joyful experience. It wasn't just the exposure of communing with nature, which was an unbelievable surprise, but  I ended up spending hours both inside and out learning about its richness and beauty, not to mention discovering all the educational opportunities. If you're from the greater Madison area or perhaps just visiting - this is a 5-star experience in my book. And if you have kids or grand-kids - be sure to bring them along. They will LOVE it.
Phenomenal experience for the whole family! It's amazing because you're right in the midst of an urban setting but the prairie is native and the setting is stunning. My daughter loved seeing the turtles floating on logs and the rabbits hopping along the trails. We became a member on our first visit. It's a great organization to support.
With the rapid growth of a large city like ours comes environmental issues such as the threat of destruction of natural habitats. But close to downtown, on Central Avenue near the Rio Salado (Salt River) you will find an important resource for better appreciating our Sonoran desert environment and  the importance of conservation of species diversity.  The Nina Mason Pulliam Rio Salado Audubon Center is a state-of-the-art, environmentally-friendly complex adjacent to Phoenix's 600-acre Rio Salado Habitat Restoration Area, an environmental restoration that stretches along several miles of the Salt River. The Center gives visitors of all ages a chance to experience this natural habitat and interact with Sonoran Desert wildlife, in an area close to downtown Phoenix. You'll find interactive displays, varied programs, nature trails, a wetland area, and a chance to see firsthand some conservation measures in effect:  an ecologically engineered treatment and wastewater reclamation system that processes the Center's wastewater for irrigation use, and an array of solar panels that provide some of the Center's electrical energy.
Aha, it's an ideal time to update my review from a year & a half ago for this place!  Norm R. & I got together tonight for the monthly "Birds & Beer" event here at the Audubon Center.  Like their FUN bird walks held every other Saturday morning at 8:30 most of the year (starting up again Sept. 10 I think), this event is excellent & FREE, including snack food & beer, courtesy of Tempe micro brewer Four Peaks!  Along with that, you get fellowship with a fun, eclectic crowd, & then a lecture with slides & short videos.  Tonight's topic was "Reptile Sex" & it was a hoot!Just like the bird walks (see my original review), "Birds & Beer is 5 STARS!  What a great place this is!     :-))
While at Birds n' Beer last Thursday, I learned what "riparian zone" means. It is the strip between land and stream or lake. (Cue the "The More  You Know" clip)The center itself is beautiful and great for a small - medium sized event. Lots of modern architecture and what looks like reclaimed materials. It's an eco-friendly building with great native landscaping.Now to the real part of the review: Bird and Beer is a great event, if you are free on a Thursday night between 5:30p and 7:30p. 5:30 to 6:30 is a chattingsnackingdrinking time with Four Peaks beer in a can. The lecture starts at 6:30 and is very informative. This month was reptile sex and last month was bird sex. The events are usually listed on the events section of Yelp, so check it out now.The Center is easy to find. It is just south of the river on Central, with a sign posted on the road pointing towards the building and the parking lot.
My trip should have been aptly called "Beards and Beer" instead of the "birds n beers."  Apparently I missed out on the typical "sex" themed talks, IE. frog sex, bird sex and flower sex.  Since this was the last event of the year, visitors got a stand up routine about beards from an official Beardo.  Wildly funny and entertaining stand up, the Four Peaks beer might have helped.  Four Peaks provided their main staple beers: Kilt lifter, Hop Knot and Kolsch.  3 styles to meet any palate.  Stop by and you'll meet their passionate staff and some friendly bird n beer enthusiasts.  There's no better way to to unwind after work, and learn a few things about that nature thing outside.
Phoenix is one of only 6 cities to get a center like this. They've taken a derelict parcel of ground and converted it into something beautiful and sustainable. Every time I go I see some special bird or bug that I haven't seen before. The River Pathways program is amazing and available to kids who might otherwise not get an experience like this.
Only thirty minutes from Phoenix, there is this nice state park where gold was once discovered and there are trails too hike. The Superstition Mountains are quite stunning up close with jagged edges, deep canyons and huge rock formations. Most trails are shorter than two miles roundtrip and those are the "learning" trails that are used by seniors and families mostly. The big boy trail is the Siphon Pass trail in which you can get all the way to the top of the 4300 foot mountain. I went to the Basin which is at about 3300 feet. The rest of the way up is a harder unmarked trail and more rocky and it was approaching 90, so I stopped. It still was just over 4 miles roundtrip and a good uphill workout on a well-carved out trail. There were lizards galore and some strange bees with a giant red dot on them, but they didn't bug me at all. Admission to the park is $7, but the scenery makes it worthy.      Stopping just down the road later for a "pop" as it was written, one of those old-timer bearded locals told me to drive another mile and you can enter the park for hiking for free. Apacheland is right before the park and they have a museum and some replica's of buildings from the old days to check out fr free.  Also, alot of movies were filmed around there, mostly Elvis stuff and be sure to take a peak inside the church also because it's surprising what you will find.
It was such a treat to be out here after a couple of days of rain in AZ. The dessert was in bloom and there is absolutely nothing like running dessert trails in the beautiful state of Arizona. Because of time constraints, we opted to loop around Treasure trail for a short runhike. I was really sorry not to have brought a real camera. It was so beautiful out there. Like any other state farms, I would not go on a weekend to enjoy the park more.
What do you do when you need to get your cycling training but just do not have any desire to tote your road bike on vacation with you Rent a road bike right But, nobody rents road bikes. SO you thought. With an upcoming metric century and a desperate need for some training miles, I decided to do a google search with only little hope to find something. Thank goodness, AOA EXISTS!!!! This company offers tours, team building and bike rentals (including both mountain bikes and ROAD bikes.) And, don't think they just rent out 1970's 10 speeds either. They have Trek and Specialized road bikes in three classes. There is standard, performance, and high performance. I Each class is a different price. I opted for the middle of the road. I figured it would be much like my bike at home. I chose the Specialized over the Trek, since I ride a Specialized regularly. The components were mainly shimano, and the saddle Specialized. I made sure to bring my gel saddle, sure that my comfy girlie saddle from home would not come standard. A good bike overall, for mid range. The staff was very nice. They were able to take my reservation an hour before my ride and had what I needed in house. I showed up and within 10 minutes had my bike, an emergency  kit (C02 cartridges, tire, tools), and a route map for the area that could be modified to meet my needs. WHAT A RIDE! Ok, so it was not NAPA, but you cannot expect that in the desert. Some great landscapes, some steady elevation gains, some quiet roads, some wildlife (rabbits mainly), and a gorgeous sunny day in March. It just doesn't get much better than that .I cannot rate this place on their tours or their team building, but I will most definitely be back to rent a road bike when I am in the Scottsdale area. I will make sure that I make a reservation in advance, though, since this rare find is likely to leak out ! Cant wait to come back and ride again later in the year!!! Thanks AOA.
A great place! Fast, friendly service and the bike I rented was well tuned. They also provided a couple of good routes for riding.
I used AOA about a month ago for some group team building activities.  I have to say, I was very impressed from day one with the service they provided.  Bernard was able to work with me on my time, budget, and activity needs to come up with 2 different activities for the group.  We did the Team Orienteering and the comination of building a bike for charity & then a bike ride in the dessert.  The Mountain biking activity was a HUGE hit, the Team Orienteering wasn't a big hit but that wasn't the fault of AOA...it just wasn't a good fit for my group.  When I called Bernard a few days out to say that I needed to make sure my CEO had a hard bike ride, he assured me Seth would take care of him.  As is turned out...Seth gave our CEO a private ride which he loved and talked about for the duration of the conference.AOA had helpful friendly staff and excellent equipment.  All the staff seemed to really be excited about what they do and helping out-of-towners enjoy themsleves.  In the end, our CEO was happy and the attendees really enjoyed themselves...which made me happy.I hope to be able to work with AOA again in the future!
My boyfriend and I were looking to rent bikes for a day and The Bicycle Ranch on FLW directed us to Arizona Outback Adventures. Their main business is hikingbiking tours, but I still wanted to review them because they were so friendly and helpful with our little rental! They got us set up with bikes and helmets quickly (each bike was $25 for a few hours). They gave us a map and suggested specific trails that we take and said they would come pick out to help us if we got a flat. Great group of people and excellent customer service. I'd imagine they're great with their toursactivities!
Excellent bike selection, quick in and out, knowledgeable employees on the trails around Scottsdale.  Exact combo I was looking for while on vacation.  Will use again.
This cycle shop rocks.  Quick and friendly service despite my late arrival (my bad).  They had a lot of rental options to choose from.  Recommend this place for rentals.  And they are close to the entrance to the preserve.
I can't say enough good things about this ranch. My sister and I wanted to reconnect and had been to two dude ranches as children. We searched for a small family-run ranch and we found exactly what we wanted.The Flying E Ranch feels exactly like the ranches from the 1960's (except for the hot tub and the ranch store). The place is charmingly decorated and there are many antiques and special touches such as photo albums featuring every guest.Most guests that we met had been there for multiple visits so that is a good recommendation in itself. The staff was charming and service was great. Everyone we met there was nice. There was a happy hour for adults every night which was fun. We are on a vegan diet right now and they accommodated us with perfect entrees at every meal.The desert is beautiful, good bird-watching, hiking, you can see the stars!, the horses were well-behaved, the wranglers took safety very seriously, even the elderly could ride there, you don't have to ride. There are rides twice a day, we did once a day. There are museums, mine tours, lots of day trips, and golf courses in the area. There were other activities such as square dancing!! which I couldn't believe we did but it was a blast. Team penning, lunch rides, etc. I think this is an excellent place for a reunion of family and friends. You can see your loved ones interacting with other people as everyone eats together. There is plenty for kids to do. I played ping pong with some kids. We also had a private kitchen with a fridge (shared with another room). They fill up well in advance so make your plans early.Really.
